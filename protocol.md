# Multi-AI Mathematical Research Protocol

## Agents

The default four-agent panel is:

1. `gpt_pro_thinking`: broad strategic reasoning through the ChatGPT web UI.
2. `gemini_deep_think`: alternate high-level reasoning through the Gemini web UI.
3. `qwen_api`: API-based algebraic and analytic exploration.
4. `deepseek_api`: API-based proof criticism and counterexample search.

Any agent can be replaced as long as it follows the same output schema.

## Round Structure

Rounds use a strict barrier synchronization rule:

- Stage B cannot begin until every agent has completed Stage A.
- Stage C cannot begin until every agent has completed Stage B.
- Stage D cannot begin until the judge synthesis is complete.
- The next round cannot begin until Stage D has been committed and pushed.

### Stage A: Independent Reasoning

Each agent receives:

- the problem statement,
- the current reading packet,
- the current lemma bank,
- the current gap register,
- the prior judge decision if available,
- the agent-specific task.

The agent must output:

```text
Summary:
Main claim or direction:
Detailed reasoning:
Dependencies:
Potential gaps:
Counterexample or obstruction search:
Useful lemmas:
What should be tested next:
Confidence:
```

### Stage B: Cross Review

Each agent reviews all other agents' Stage A outputs.

The review must output:

```text
Most valuable input from others:
Claims that look correct:
Claims that need proof:
Possible errors or hidden assumptions:
Suggested synthesis:
Score by agent:
Next-round recommendation:
```

### Stage C: Judge Synthesis

The judge reads all Stage A outputs and Stage B reviews.

The judge must output:

```text
Selected main route:
Useful fragments by source:
Rejected or risky ideas:
Known gaps:
New lemmas to add:
Counterexample checks to run:
Next round instructions:
Confidence:
```

### Stage D: State Update

The orchestrator updates:

- `state/current_state.md`: compact current research state.
- `state/lemma_bank.md`: proposed, proved, and rejected lemmas.
- `state/gap_register.md`: known gaps and possible failure points.
- `state/best_proof_draft.md`: best current proof skeleton.
- `manifests/reading_packet.md`: the compact packet for the next round.

## Public Repo Rule

The public GitHub repo is the permanent log. Every completed round should be committed and pushed.

Agents should normally read `manifests/reading_packet.md`, not the full repo. Full round files remain available for audit and later reconstruction.

## Human Intervention Rule

Human intervention is allowed at any time between stages or rounds.

Human input can appear in:

- `human/current_directives.md`
- `human/goals.md`
- `human/ideas.md`
- `human/references.md`
- `human/inbox/*.md`
- GitHub issues or comments that are manually copied into the files above

Human instructions override previous AI suggestions when they change the target, introduce a reference, reject a route, add a constraint, or change the success criterion.

Agents must explicitly acknowledge relevant human interventions in their next output.

## Mathematical Safety Rules

- Do not mark a claim as proved unless the proof is explicit.
- Preserve failed attempts; they help avoid repeated false starts.
- When a proof step uses an external theorem, name the theorem and state the needed hypotheses.
- Require counterexample search for any new lemma.
- Prefer small checkable lemmas over broad vague routes.
- Keep notation stable across rounds.
