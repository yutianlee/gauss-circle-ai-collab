Selected main route:

Keep the current arithmetic route, but explicitly downgrade its status from “promising proof route” to “structured reduction plus obstruction map.”

The selected route remains:

$$
P(X)=N(\sqrt X)-\pi X
\to
\text{symmetric hyperbola}
\to
\text{floor-compatible sawtooth}
\to
\text{finite Vaaler}
\to
\text{local dyadic reciprocal sums}.
$$

Here $X=R^2$, and the conjectural target is

$$
P(X)\ll_\epsilon X^{1/4+\epsilon}.
$$

The active Round 5 judge prompt requires synthesis only for the two active agents, `gpt_pro_thinking` and `gemini_deep_think`; inactive-agent references are historical noise.

Round 5 changes the research state in one important way: **H5r is now the central bottleneck.** The Vaaler residual is not a removable technical nuisance. Its Fejer-majorant expansion produces parity-supported and untwisted reciprocal sums, which are structurally close to divisor-problem sums and may dominate the route.

The next round should therefore pursue two tracks in parallel:

1. **Complete the Vaaler route honestly**, with H5r treated as a mandatory endpoint-strength target.
2. **Explore non-majorizing alternatives**, because the positive Fejer majorant may be the mechanism that destroys the useful $\chi_4$ sign structure.

No improvement to the Gauss circle exponent has been proved.

Useful fragments by source:

## From `gpt_pro_thinking`

The most useful contribution is the clean insertion of H4 and H5r into the proof skeleton.

The proved arithmetic foundation remains:

$$
P(X)
=
-4\sum_{a\le y}\chi_4(a)\psi(X/a)
+
4\sum_{b\le y}
\left[
\psi\left(\frac{X/b+1}{4}\right)
-
\psi\left(\frac{X/b+3}{4}\right)
\right]
+
O(1),
$$

where

$$
y=\lfloor X^{1/2}\rfloor,
\qquad
\psi(t)=t-\lfloor t\rfloor-\frac12.
$$

This is a floor-compatible identity, not a Fourier identity. The value at integers is $\psi(n)=-1/2$.

The Vaaler dependency is now explicit. For $H\ge 1$,

$$
\psi(t)
=
\sum_{1\le |h|\le H}\alpha_h e(ht)
+
R_H(t),
\qquad
\alpha_h\ll |h|^{-1},
$$

with pointwise residual majorant

$$
|R_H(t)|
\le
\frac{1}{2H+2}K_H(t),
$$

where

$$
K_H(t)
=
\sum_{|k|\le H}
\left(1-\frac{|k|}{H+1}\right)e(kt).
$$

The important point is that the residual must be expanded through $K_H$; it cannot be replaced by a scalar $O(D/H_D)$ before summing over $d$.

For a dyadic denominator block $d\asymp D$, the local Vaaler height remains

$$
H_D\asymp D X^{-1/4},
\qquad
X^{1/4}\le D\le X^{1/2}.
$$

Short blocks $D<X^{1/4}$ are harmless by the trivial estimate.

The Vaaler main terms lead to the two endpoint-strength targets:

$$
B_1(H_0,D;X)
=
\sum_{h\sim H_0}u_h
\sum_d
\chi_4(d)w_D(d)e(hX/d),
$$

and

$$
B_2(H_0,D;X)
=
\sum_{h\sim H_0}u_h\chi_4(h)
\sum_d
w_D(d)e(hX/(4d)).
$$

A sufficient target is

$$
B_i(H_0,D;X)
\ll_\epsilon
H_0X^{1/4+\epsilon},
\qquad i=1,2,
$$

uniformly for

$$
X^{1/4}\le D\le X^{1/2},
\qquad
1\le H_0\le D X^{-1/4}.
$$

The decisive Round 5 refinement is the explicit residual family H5r. The first residual produces parity-supported sums

$$
C_1(K_0,D;X)
=
\sum_{k\sim K_0}v_k
\sum_d
1_{2\nmid d}w_D(d)e(kX/d),
$$

and the second residual produces shifted untwisted sums

$$
C_{2,\rho}(K_0,D;X)
=
\sum_{k\sim K_0}v_k e(k\rho/4)
\sum_d
w_D(d)e(kX/(4d)),
\qquad
\rho\in\{1,3\}.
$$

A sufficient residual target is

$$
C_1(K_0,D;X),\ C_{2,\rho}(K_0,D;X)
\ll_\epsilon
K_0X^{1/4+\epsilon},
$$

uniformly for $K_0\le H_D$.

This is now part of the analytic core. It is not optional.

The second useful contribution is the comparison of H5r with Li--Yang/Bombieri--Iwaniec-type reciprocal sums. After residue splitting, H5r has the same broad phase class

$$
e\left(\frac{kX}{d}\right)
=
e\left(\frac{kT}{M}F(d/M)\right),
\qquad
F(x)=1/x,
$$

with $T=X$ and $M=D$. The usual derivative checks are clean:

$$
F'(x)=-x^{-2},
\qquad
F''(x)=2x^{-3},
\qquad
F'''(x)=-6x^{-4},
$$

and

$$
F'(x)F'''(x)-3F''(x)^2
=
-6x^{-6}.
$$

Thus the phase is structurally in the Li--Yang reciprocal-sum class. The problem is the exponent: known technology reaches $\theta^*=0.314483\ldots$ in $X$-notation, while the conjectural target is $\theta=1/4$.

The third useful contribution is the minimal Poisson--Bessel calibration module. This should remain in the repo as a sanity check:

$$
S_\delta(R)-\pi R^2
=
R\sum_{k\ne 0}
\frac{J_1(2\pi R|k|)}{|k|}
\widehat\rho(\delta k),
$$

together with the smoothing sandwich

$$
E(R)
\ll
R\delta+
\sup_{|t-R|\le C\delta}|S_\delta(t)-\pi t^2|.
$$

Using trivial dyadic bounds gives

$$
E(R)\ll R\delta+R^{1/2}\delta^{-1/2},
$$

and balancing at $\delta=R^{-1/3}$ recovers

$$
E(R)\ll R^{2/3}.
$$

This is a calibration route, not the main analytic route.

## From `gemini_deep_think`

The most useful contribution is the “Fejer Majorant DDP Trap” diagnostic.

The point is precise: the Vaaler residual is controlled by a nonnegative Fejer kernel. After expanding the majorant, the first residual family contains $1_{2\nmid d}$ rather than $\chi_4(d)$. Thus the signed two-square character has been replaced by parity support.

This makes H5r structurally divisor-like. That does not prove an impossibility theorem, but it identifies the likely bottleneck of the Vaaler route.

Gemini’s second useful contribution is the dual parity collapse check. If one applies a B-process to the parity residual

$$
\sum_d 1_{2\nmid d}w(d/D)e(kX/d),
$$

then splitting modulo $2$ should produce a dual factor essentially $(-1)^m$. A direct A-process in the dual variable gives

$$
(-1)^m(-1)^{m+q}=(-1)^q,
$$

which is constant in $m$.

This is the parity analogue of H7. It says that B-process-first may preserve $\chi_4$ for the signed main term H5a, but it does not obviously rescue the parity residual H5r.

Gemini’s third useful contribution is the non-majorizing truncation suggestion. The claim should not be accepted as a theorem, but the route is worth testing: if the positive Fejer majorant is the mechanism that destroys $\chi_4$, then one should compare Vaaler against signed finite Fourier truncations, Perron/Mellin methods, or exact discrete transforms.

Rejected or risky ideas:

1. **Reject: “H5r is just an error term.”**

   H5r is part of the analytic core. Without endpoint-strength bounds for $C_1$ and $C_{2,\rho}$, the Vaaler route does not imply the conjectural bound.

2. **Reject: “The Vaaler residual is only $O(D/H_D)$.”**

   The zeroth Fejer mode gives $D/H_D$, but the nonzero modes give reciprocal sums. Omitting them is a false proof.

3. **Reject: “H5a success would solve the route.”**

   Even if the signed spatial-character main family $B_1$ is controlled, the parity/untwisted residual H5r may still block the argument.

4. **Reject: “Fejer Majorant DDP Trap is a theorem.”**

   It is currently a diagnostic obstruction, not a proved lower bound or equivalence. To become a theorem, it would need a formal reduction from H5r to a divisor-problem endpoint estimate, or a lower-bound construction showing unavoidable size.

5. **Reject: “Continuous Fourier truncation methods are exhausted.”**

   Positive-majorant Vaaler creates a serious problem, but there may be signed truncations, blockwise cancellation among Fejer modes, Perron/Mellin formulations, or bilinear methods that avoid the crude majorant loss.

6. **Reject: “B-process-first solves the character problem.”**

   H8 preserves $\chi_4$ in the dual variable for the signed main term, but direct differencing in the dual variable triggers H7 again. For the parity residual, B-process appears to produce an alternating dual factor whose direct differencing collapses immediately.

7. **Reject: “H6 rules out all character-blind methods.”**

   H6 only applies to methods that treat the outer frequency variable trivially and then apply a one-dimensional exponent-pair estimate to the inner reciprocal sum. It does not rule out double large sieve, Bombieri--Iwaniec spacing, bilinear estimates, or decoupling-type methods that preserve the two-variable structure.

8. **Reject: “Current Li--Yang technology reaches H5.”**

   Li--Yang-type methods provide the correct structural comparison class, but current known exponents remain above $1/4$ in $X$-notation. H5a, H5b, and H5r are endpoint-strength targets.

Known gaps:

1. **External Vaaler theorem verification.**

   The exact coefficient formula and residual majorant should be verified against a standard reference before H4 is marked as an imported theorem dependency. The proof draft may use the majorant form, but it must cite the theorem precisely.

2. **H5r-to-Li--Yang dictionary.**

   For $C_1$ and $C_{2,\rho}$, the repo must write the exact transformation to Li--Yang-type sums:
   - residue splitting;
   - phase $F(x)$;
   - local range $K_0\le D X^{-1/4}$;
   - smoothness and bounded variation of $v_k,w_D$;
   - where absolute values enter;
   - whether the theorem being invoked permits these weights.

3. **Absolute-value placement in H5r.**

   The intended H5r target should use smooth dyadic $k$-weights and at most one block-level absolute value. A termwise absolute value over $k$ is too crude and may artificially create the DDP trap.

4. **C1 is not yet a theorem.**

   The Fejer Majorant DDP Trap must be formulated conditionally. A correct statement is:

   If H5r is bounded only by known character-blind reciprocal-sum estimates with exponent $\theta$, then the Vaaler route gives at best $P(X)\ll_\epsilon X^{\theta+\epsilon}$.

   This is not a lower bound and not a proof that H5r cannot reach $\theta=1/4$.

5. **C2 parity-dual calculation needs proof.**

   The claim that B-process maps $1_{2\nmid d}$ to an alternating dual factor should be verified by an explicit Poisson calculation modulo $2$, including normalization, nonstationary terms, and possible zero-frequency contributions.

6. **Non-majorizing truncation alternatives are undeveloped.**

   The three main alternatives need exact error terms:
   - signed finite Fourier truncation;
   - Perron/Mellin formula for $4\zeta(s)L(s,\chi_4)$;
   - exact discrete or arithmetic transform avoiding positive pointwise majorants.

7. **H8 still lacks a uniform stationary-phase lemma.**

   The Poisson-dual formula for

$$
   \sum_d\chi_4(d)w(d/D)e(hX/d)
$$

   has been structurally derived, with dual length $m\asymp hX/D^2$, but constants, endpoint errors, transition ranges, and uniformity over the local Vaaler range remain unchecked.

8. **H9 degeneracy remains a guardrail.**

   The B-process dual phase

$$
   \Phi(h,m)=\sqrt{Xhm}
$$

   has zero continuous Hessian. Therefore generic full-rank two-dimensional stationary phase or decoupling cannot be applied directly. This does not rule out discrete Bombieri--Iwaniec spacing.

9. **Poisson--Bessel calibration is not yet committed as a checked module.**

   The calibration proof should be inserted into the repo to stabilize smoothing and normalization conventions.

New lemmas to add:

## H1. Exact symmetric hyperbola identity

Status: proved.

For $X\ge 1$, $y=\lfloor X^{1/2}\rfloor$, and

$$
S(u)=\sum_{1\le a\le u}\chi_4(a),
$$

one has

$$
\sum_{ab\le X}\chi_4(a)
=
\sum_{a\le y}\chi_4(a)\left\lfloor\frac Xa\right\rfloor
+
\sum_{b\le y}S(X/b)
-
yS(y).
$$

## H2. Exact periodic formula for $S(u)$

Status: proved.

For real $u\ge 0$,

$$
S(u)
=
\left\lfloor\frac{u+3}{4}\right\rfloor
-
\left\lfloor\frac{u+1}{4}\right\rfloor
=
\frac12+
\psi\left(\frac{u+1}{4}\right)
-
\psi\left(\frac{u+3}{4}\right).
$$

## H3. Balanced sawtooth formula

Status: proved as an $O(1)$ floor-compatible identity.

For $X\ge 1$,

$$
P(X)
=
-4\sum_{a\le y}\chi_4(a)\psi(X/a)
+
4\sum_{b\le y}
\left[
\psi\left(\frac{X/b+1}{4}\right)
-
\psi\left(\frac{X/b+3}{4}\right)
\right]
+
O(1).
$$

## H4. Finite Vaaler with Fejer residual

Status: external theorem dependency; exact reference still to verify.

Use a finite approximation

$$
\psi(t)
=
\sum_{1\le |h|\le H}\alpha_h e(ht)
+
R_H(t),
\qquad
\alpha_h\ll |h|^{-1},
$$

with

$$
|R_H(t)|
\le
\frac{1}{2H+2}K_H(t).
$$

The proof draft must retain the Fejer residual.

## H5a. Spatial-character local dyadic target

Status: sufficient target, not known.

For

$$
X^{1/4}\le D\le X^{1/2},
\qquad
1\le H_0\le D X^{-1/4},
$$

prove

$$
B_1(H_0,D;X)
\ll_\epsilon
H_0X^{1/4+\epsilon}.
$$

## H5b. Frequency-character local dyadic target

Status: sufficient target, not known.

For the same range, prove

$$
B_2(H_0,D;X)
\ll_\epsilon
H_0X^{1/4+\epsilon}.
$$

## H5r. Fejer-residual local dyadic targets

Status: required sufficient target, not known.

For smooth Fejer/dyadic weights, prove

$$
C_1(K_0,D;X)
\ll_\epsilon
K_0X^{1/4+\epsilon},
$$

and

$$
C_{2,\rho}(K_0,D;X)
\ll_\epsilon
K_0X^{1/4+\epsilon}.
$$

The first target is parity-supported; the second is untwisted with a frequency shift. These are likely the central bottleneck.

## H6. Conditional one-dimensional exponent-pair diagnostic

Status: diagnostic, not theorem.

Under the standard reciprocal-phase convention $T\asymp hX/D$, a method that treats $h$ trivially and applies only a one-dimensional exponent-pair estimate in $d$ must satisfy

$$
3\kappa+2\lambda\le 1
$$

at the endpoint block $D\asymp X^{1/2}$, $H_0\asymp X^{1/4}$.

## H7. A-process modulus degeneracy for $\chi_4$

Status: proved.

For every integer $q$,

$$
\chi_4(d)\chi_4(d+q)
=
\begin{cases}
1_{2\nmid d},& q\equiv 0\pmod 4,\\
-1_{2\nmid d},& q\equiv 2\pmod 4,\\
0,& q\equiv 1,3\pmod 4.
\end{cases}
$$

## H8. B-process-first character-dualization

Status: partially derived; not yet a proof input.

For smooth compact support away from zero,

$$
\sum_d\chi_4(d)w(d/D)e(hX/d)
$$

has a Poisson-dual form with dual character $\chi_4(n)$ and dual length

$$
|n|\asymp hX/D^2.
$$

It preserves the character but does not prove cancellation.

## H9. B-process dual Hessian degeneracy

Status: proved diagnostic.

For

$$
\Phi(h,m)=\sqrt{Xhm},
$$

one has

$$
\det\nabla^2\Phi=0.
$$

Generic full-rank two-dimensional stationary phase or decoupling cannot be applied directly to this dual phase.

## C1. Fejer Majorant DDP Trap

Status: diagnostic obstruction heuristic, not theorem.

The Vaaler residual majorant produces parity-supported or untwisted reciprocal sums, especially $C_1$ and $C_{2,\rho}$, which no longer contain $\chi_4(d)$. These should be compared to divisor-problem reciprocal sums. A proof that C1 is a barrier requires a formal reduction or lower-bound example.

## C2. Dual parity degeneration for H5r

Status: proposed algebraic lemma pending Poisson normalization.

If B-process sends $1_{2\nmid d}$ to an alternating dual factor $(-1)^m$, then direct differencing gives

$$
(-1)^m(-1)^{m+q}=(-1)^q.
$$

Thus the parity factor carries no usable oscillation after an A-process. This is the H5r analogue of H7.

## H10. Non-majorizing truncation requirement

Status: proposed strategic route.

Seek an alternative to positive-majorant Vaaler residuals that preserves sign information in the truncation error. Candidate directions:
- signed finite Fourier truncation;
- Perron/Mellin formula for $4\zeta(s)L(s,\chi_4)$;
- exact discrete transforms.

For each candidate, state the exact error term replacing H5r.

## B1. Poisson--Bessel calibration module

Status: secondary proof module to add.

Prove the smoothed Poisson--Bessel formula, the smoothing sandwich, and recovery of $E(R)\ll R^{2/3}$ from trivial dyadic estimates.

Counterexample checks to run:

1. **Fejer spike test.**

   Test $X,d$ such that one of

$$
   X/d,\qquad
   \frac{X/d+1}{4},\qquad
   \frac{X/d+3}{4}
$$

   is near an integer. Then $K_H$ can be large, and H5r must cover the resulting contribution.

2. **Residual absolute-value placement test.**

   Compare three residual treatments:
   - scalar $D/H_D$ only;
   - blockwise absolute values after dyadic $k$-decomposition;
   - termwise absolute values in $k$.

   The first is incomplete. The third is too crude. The second is the intended formulation.

3. **H5r-to-Li--Yang dictionary test.**

   For $C_1$ and $C_{2,\rho}$, write the exact $F(x)$, weights, local ranges, and derivative checks. Verify that the coefficients fit any theorem being invoked.

4. **C2 Poisson check.**

   Apply Poisson summation modulo $2$ to

$$
   \sum_d1_{2\nmid d}w(d/D)e(kX/d).
$$

   Identify the dual factor, stationary phase, dual length, and nonstationary terms.

5. **Dual A-process collapse test.**

   After C2, apply direct differencing to the dual alternating factor and verify that it collapses to $(-1)^q$.

6. **Non-majorizing truncation comparison.**

   Compare Vaaler, signed Fourier truncation, and Perron/Mellin approaches. For each, record whether the replacement error preserves $\chi_4$ or loses it.

7. **Bessel calibration check.**

   Insert the Poisson--Bessel smoothing module and verify that it recovers $E(R)\ll R^{2/3}$ without relying on the arithmetic route.

Next round instructions:

## For `gpt_pro_thinking`

Produce a Stage A packet focused on H5r and non-majorizing alternatives.

Tasks:

1. Formalize C1 as a conditional proposition:

   If H5r is bounded only by character-blind Li--Yang-type estimates with exponent $\theta$, then the Vaaler route gives at best $P(X)\ll_\epsilon X^{\theta+\epsilon}$.

   State the proof of this implication.

2. Write the full H5r-to-Li--Yang dictionary for $C_1$ and $C_{2,\rho}$:
   - residue classes;
   - phase $F(x)$;
   - local range;
   - smooth weights;
   - absolute-value placement;
   - theorem hypotheses needed.

3. Start the non-majorizing truncation comparison. For Vaaler, signed Fourier truncation, and Mellin-Perron, state exactly what error term replaces H5r.

4. Add the Poisson--Bessel calibration module to the best proof draft.

## For `gemini_deep_think`

Produce a Stage A packet focused on C2 and H10.

Tasks:

1. Prove or refute C2 by explicit Poisson summation modulo $2$ for

$$
   \sum_d1_{2\nmid d}w(d/D)e(kX/d).
$$

   Identify the dual factor, dual phase, dual length, and error terms.

2. Test whether B-process-first helps H5r or only transforms it into another parity-degenerate problem.

3. Sketch the Mellin-Perron alternative at lemma level:
   - exact Perron formula for $4\zeta(s)L(s,\chi_4)$;
   - contour shift;
   - residues;
   - truncation error;
   - analytic estimates needed to reach $X^{1/4+\epsilon}$.

Confidence:

High confidence in H1, H2, H3, H6, H7, and the necessity of H5r.

High confidence that the Vaaler residual cannot be treated as scalar $O(D/H_D)$.

High confidence that C1 identifies a real obstruction in the current Vaaler route.

Moderate confidence that H5r is structurally divisor-like after residue splitting.

Moderate confidence that C2 is correct, but it still needs the explicit Poisson calculation.

Low confidence that C1 is a proved barrier; it is currently a diagnostic.

Low confidence that non-majorizing truncation or Mellin-Perron avoids importing estimates as hard as the original conjecture.

No new exponent has been proved. The concrete Round 5 result is a sharper and more honest proof skeleton: the route now visibly depends on endpoint-strength bounds for H5r, and the next round must either handle those residual sums or replace the Vaaler truncation with a sign-preserving alternative.
