You are GPT Pro Thinking, acting as broad strategist, proof synthesizer, and test judge.

Review the other agents' Round 3 outputs. Your job is to identify useful mathematics, hidden assumptions, likely errors, and a synthesis path.

## Agent-Specific Instructions

Use ChatGPT Extended Pro. Give detailed, research-mode answers with precise lemma statements, dependencies, proof gaps, and next actions. When acting as judge, be concise enough to be usable but do not omit mathematical substance.

## Active Agents For This Run

Only these agents are active in this test:

- `gpt_pro_thinking` (GPT Pro Thinking): broad strategist, proof synthesizer, and test judge
- `gemini_deep_think` (Gemini Deep Think): independent alternative strategist and obstacle finder

Do not mention, score, or assign tasks to inactive agents. If older state text refers to inactive agents, treat it as historical noise and reassign any still-useful mathematical check to one of the active agents.

## Protocol

# Multi-AI Mathematical Research Protocol

## Round Structure

Rounds use a strict barrier synchronization rule:

- Stage B cannot begin until every agent has completed Stage A.
- Stage C cannot begin until every agent has completed Stage B.
- Stage D cannot begin until the judge synthesis is complete.
- The next round cannot begin until Stage D has been committed and pushed.

### Stage A: Independent Reasoning

Each agent receives:

- the problem statement,
- the current reading packet,
- the current lemma bank,
- the current gap register,
- the prior judge decision if available,
- the agent-specific task.

The agent must output:

```text
Summary:
Main claim or direction:
Detailed reasoning:
Dependencies:
Potential gaps:
Counterexample or obstruction search:
Useful lemmas:
What should be tested next:
Confidence:
```

### Stage B: Cross Review

Each agent reviews all other agents' Stage A outputs.

The review must output:

```text
Most valuable input from others:
Claims that look correct:
Claims that need proof:
Possible errors or hidden assumptions:
Suggested synthesis:
Score by agent:
Next-round recommendation:
```

### Stage C: Judge Synthesis

The judge reads all Stage A outputs and Stage B reviews.

The judge must output:

```text
Selected main route:
Useful fragments by source:
Rejected or risky ideas:
Known gaps:
New lemmas to add:
Counterexample checks to run:
Next round instructions:
Confidence:
```

### Stage D: State Update

The orchestrator updates:

- `state/current_state.md`: compact current research state.
- `state/lemma_bank.md`: proposed, proved, and rejected lemmas.
- `state/gap_register.md`: known gaps and possible failure points.
- `state/best_proof_draft.md`: best current proof skeleton.
- `manifests/reading_packet.md`: the compact packet for the next round.

## Public Repo Rule

The public GitHub repo is the permanent log. Every completed round should be committed and pushed.

Agents should normally read `manifests/reading_packet.md`, not the full repo. Full round files remain available for audit and later reconstruction.

## Human Intervention Rule

Human intervention is allowed at any time between stages or rounds.

Human input can appear in:

- `human/current_directives.md`
- `human/goals.md`
- `human/ideas.md`
- `human/references.md`
- `human/inbox/*.md`
- GitHub issues or comments that are manually copied into the files above

Human instructions override previous AI suggestions when they change the target, introduce a reference, reject a route, add a constraint, or change the success criterion.

Agents must explicitly acknowledge relevant human interventions in their next output.

## Mathematical Safety Rules

- Do not mark a claim as proved unless the proof is explicit.
- Preserve failed attempts; they help avoid repeated false starts.
- When a proof step uses an external theorem, name the theorem and state the needed hypotheses.
- Require counterexample search for any new lemma.
- Prefer small checkable lemmas over broad vague routes.
- Keep notation stable across rounds.

## Markdown Output Rule

Return clean Markdown source. For mathematics, use only:

- inline math: `$...$`
- display math:

```text
$$
...
$$
```

Do not use rendered-equation copy formats. Do not use bare bracket math like `[ ... ]`.
Avoid `\[ ... \]` and `\( ... \)` because some web copy tools drop the backslashes.

## Research-Mode Quality Rubric

This is a research-mode run, not a smoke test. Take enough time to reason carefully before answering. Prefer correctness, explicit assumptions, rigorous gap detection, and precise lemma statements over speed or brevity.

Before writing the final response, internally check your proposal against known barriers, missing hypotheses, possible counterexamples, and literature-status uncertainty. In the final answer, report the refined result rather than hidden chain-of-thought.

For reasoning stages, include: main route, precise lemmas, theorem dependencies, hidden assumptions, obstruction or counterexample checks, what would falsify the route, and confidence.

For review stages, include: valuable ideas from other agents, claims that look correct, claims needing proof, likely false or underspecified claims, missing hypotheses, and concrete synthesis recommendations.

For judge stages, include: selected route, useful fragments by source, rejected or risky ideas, exact gaps, new lemma statements, next-round tasks, and confidence.

## Problem

# Gauss Circle Problem

## Problem

Let

```text
N(R) = #{(m,n) in Z^2 : m^2 + n^2 <= R^2}.
```

The classical Gauss circle problem asks for the best possible exponent in the error term

```text
N(R) = pi R^2 + E(R).
```

The conjectural bound is

```text
E(R) = O_epsilon(R^{1/2 + epsilon})
```

for every epsilon > 0.

## Research Goal For This Repo

Use a multi-AI collaborative workflow to explore strategies, partial lemmas, obstacles, and proof sketches related to improving or understanding the Gauss circle problem error term.

The immediate goal is not to claim a solution, but to build a rigorous research log:

- identify plausible approaches,
- isolate precise lemmas,
- track gaps,
- test claims against known barriers,
- maintain a best current proof skeleton.

## Initial Directions To Consider

- Poisson summation and Bessel function expansions.
- Exponential sum bounds and exponent pairs.
- Smoothing and unsmoothing arguments.
- Lattice point discrepancy methods.
- Connections to the divisor problem.
- Lower-bound obstructions and omega results.
- Computational checks for small or structured ranges.

## Current State Bundle

# Current Research State

No completed rounds yet.

The first round should focus on strategy selection, known barriers, and a clean decomposition of the Gauss circle error term.

## Round 1 Update

Timestamp: 2026-05-31 22:51:21

See `rounds/web-research-test/round_001/judge/judge.md`.

Selected main route:

Adopt a **two-track decomposition, with the arithmetic hyperbola/sawtooth route as the main analytic route and the smoothed Poisson--Bessel route as a normalization and sanity-check route**.

The main Round 2 objective should not be "prove the conjecture." It should be to produce a verified, endpoint-safe reduction from

$$
E(R)=N(R)-\pi R^2
$$

to balanced dyadic sums coming from the identity

$$
r_2(n)=4\sum_{d\mid n}\chi_4(d),
$$

with $X=R^2$ and target

$$
P(X):=N(\sqrt X)-\pi X=O_\epsilon(X^{1/4+\epsilon}).
$$

The selected analytic route is:

1. Prove an exact **symmetric Dirichlet hyperbola identity** for

$$
T(X):=\sum_{ab\le X}\chi_4(a),
\qquad
N(\sqrt X)=1+4T(X).
$$

2. Convert this identity into sawtooth terms using

$$
\psi(t)=t-\lfloor t\rfloor-\frac12
$$

with explicit endpoint conventions.

3. Apply Vaaler truncation only after the hyperbola cut, so the sums have length about $\sqrt X$ rather than $X$.

4. Derive the exact dyadic exponential-sum target, expected to involve sums of the schematic form

$$
\sum_{h\sim H}\frac{1}{h}
\sum_{d\sim D} c_d e\left(\frac{hX}{d}\right),
\qquad D\le X^{1/2},
$$

with $c_d$ equal either to $\chi_4(d)$ or to coefficients arising from the second hyperbola leg.

Useful fragments by source:

**From `gpt_pro_thinking`:**

The strongest contribution is the normalization into two complementary forms: a smoothed Poisson--Bessel decomposition and an arithmetic sawtooth decomposition using $r_2(n)=4\sum_{d\mid n}\chi_4(d)$. This is the right first-round foundation. The Poisson--Bessel side should remain in the repo because it gives a checkable smoothing/unsmoothing framework and recovers the classical $R^{2/3}$ estimate from trivial radial-sum bounds.

The proposed conditional benchmark

$$
A_M(R)
=
\sum_{k\ne 0}w(|k|/M)e(R|k|)
\ll_\epsilon M^{3/2}R^\epsilon
$$

is useful as a diagnostic criterion, not as a likely direct proof route. It quantifies what type of cancellation the smoothed geometric formulation would need.

The arithmetic identity

$$
P(X)
=
-4\sum_{d\le X}\chi_4(d)\psi(X/d)+O(1)
$$

is valuable as a compact exact reduction, but it should not be the final analytic form for Vaaler truncation. Before estimation, the sum should be shortened by the Dirichlet hyperbola method.

The literature-status discipline is also valuable: record Huxley, Bourgain--Watt, Li--Yang, and ANTEDB separately, and do not use any record exponent as a black-box dependency until the theorem statement and hypotheses are checked.

**From `gemini_deep_think`:**

The most useful mathematical warning is that the raw geometric phase

$$
R\sqrt{x^2+y^2}
$$

and the homogeneous model phase

$$
R\sqrt{ab}
$$

have rank-deficient Hessian. Therefore any proposed proof that applies a generic full-rank two-dimensional stationary phase or decoupling theorem directly to these phases is invalid.

The proposed symmetric hyperbola route is also useful. The exact formula as stated by Gemini should not be marked proved, but the idea of replacing the length-$X$ sawtooth sum with a balanced hyperbola decomposition is correct and should become the main Round 2 task. Gemini's review also correctly flags the analytic cost of applying Vaaler directly to the unbalanced $d\le X$ identity.

Gemini's "character blindness" warning is worth preserving as a gap: after reduction to exponential sums, one must know whether $\chi_4$ is actually being exploited or merely discarded by absolute values. However, this warning needs to be converted into precise coefficient classes and estimates.

**From `gpt_pro_thinking` Stage B review:**

The review correctly demotes Gemini's exact hyperbola formula from "proved" to "proposed." It also gives the right next-step decomposition: split the hyperbola assertion into smaller lemmas H1--H4, separating exact counting, periodic partial sums, main-term cancellation, and Vaaler truncation.

Rejected or risky ideas:

1. **Reject as proved: Gemini's exact hyperbola formula.**
   The formula

$$
E(R)
=
-4\sum_{a\le R}\chi_4(a)\psi(R^2/a)
+
4\sum_{b\le R}
\left[
\psi\left(\frac{R^2/b+1}{4}\right)
-
\psi\left(\frac{R^2/b+3}{4}\right)
\right]
+
O(1)
$$

is plausible in spirit, but it was not proved in Round 1. It must be derived from an exact hyperbola identity with $y=\lfloor \sqrt X\rfloor$, explicit endpoint conventions, and a verified bounded residual.

2. **Reject: "nonzero Hessian unlocks modern decoupling" as a theorem.**
   For the phase

$$
\Phi(h,d)=\frac{hX}{d},
$$

the formal Hessian determinant in continuous variables is nonzero. That calculation is correct, but it does not by itself imply that Bourgain--Watt, Bombieri--Iwaniec, or any decoupling theorem applies. The needed theorem, coefficient hypotheses, dyadic ranges, spacing conditions, and loss factors must be stated.

3. **Reject: abandoning Bessel methods entirely.**
   The Bessel route is risky as a direct source of new exponents because of radial degeneracy. It is still useful for smoothing, unsmoothing, checking notation, and recovering the classical $R^{2/3}$ sanity bound.

4. **Reject: "smoothing artificially erases point-mass spikes."**
   Smoothing without an unsmoothing argument is dangerous. Standard smoothing with a sandwich lemma is legitimate and should remain in the technical toolkit.

5. **Treat as risky: the radial benchmark $A_M(R)\ll M^{3/2}R^\epsilon$.**
   It is a clean sufficient condition, but not a near-term lemma. The Hessian warning suggests that generic two-dimensional nondegenerate tools are unavailable for this raw radial phase.

Known gaps:

1. **Endpoint conventions for $\psi$.**
   The identity

$$
\lfloor t\rfloor=t-\psi(t)-\frac12
$$

is exact if $\psi(t)=t-\lfloor t\rfloor-\frac12$, including $\psi(n)=-1/2$ at integers. Fourier series and Vaaler approximations usually behave differently at discontinuities. This must be recorded explicitly.

2. **Exact symmetric hyperbola identity.**
   The repo needs a proved identity for

$$
T(X)=\sum_{ab\le X}\chi_4(a)
$$

with $y=\lfloor\sqrt X\rfloor$:

$$
T(X)
=
\sum_{a\le y}\chi_4(a)\left\lfloor\frac Xa\right\rfloor
+
\sum_{b\le y}S(X/b)
-
yS(y),
$$

where

$$
S(u)=\sum_{a\le u}\chi_4(a).
$$

3. **Periodic partial-sum formula.**
   One needs a fully checked formula for $S(u)$, for real $u$, including integer endpoints. A likely exact formula is

$$
S(u)
=
\left\lfloor\frac{u+3}{4}\right\rfloor
- \left\lfloor\frac{u+1}{4}\right\rfloor
=
\frac12+
\psi\left(\frac{u+1}{4}\right)
-
\psi\left(\frac{u+3}{4}\right),
$$

with the same floor-compatible convention for $\psi$.

4. **Main-term cancellation after the symmetric cut.**
   After substituting the floor and $S(u)$ formulas, the nonoscillatory terms must be shown to equal $\pi X/4+O(1)$ at the level of $T(X)$. This is the critical algebraic step behind Gemini's proposed formula.

5. **Vaaler truncation error.**
   The truncation error must be derived with full dependence on the length $D$, Fourier height $H$, and endpoint/jump terms. The heuristic "error is length divided by $H$" is not enough.

6. **Dyadic parameter map.**
   The route needs a precise map from the hyperbola formula to dyadic ranges $D,H,T$, with $T=X$, $D\le X^{1/2}$, and $H$ chosen according to the actual Vaaler error. This must precede any appeal to Bombieri--Iwaniec-type estimates.

7. **Coefficient handling.**
   The role of $\chi_4(d)$ must be explicit. The repo should distinguish estimates that exploit the character from estimates that merely bound $|c_d|\le 1$.

8. **Literature audit.**
   Record-exponent claims should be audited from primary sources before being treated as dependencies.

New lemmas to add:

**Lemma H1: Exact symmetric hyperbola identity.**
Status: proposed, expected standard.

For $X\ge 1$, set $y=\lfloor\sqrt X\rfloor$ and

$$
S(u)=\sum_{1\le a\le u}\chi_4(a).
$$

Then

$$
\sum_{ab\le X}\chi_4(a)
=
\sum_{a\le y}\chi_4(a)\left\lfloor\frac Xa\right\rfloor
+
\sum_{b\le y}S(X/b)
-
yS(y).
$$

This should be proved by covering the region $ab\le X$ by the union of $a\le y$ and $b\le y$, noting that no pair with $a>y$ and $b>y$ can satisfy $ab\le X$.

**Lemma H2: Exact periodic formula for $S(u)$.**
Status: proposed, elementary.

For real $u\ge 0$,

$$
S(u)
=
\left\lfloor\frac{u+3}{4}\right\rfloor
- \left\lfloor\frac{u+1}{4}\right\rfloor.
$$

Equivalently, with $\psi(t)=t-\lfloor t\rfloor-\frac12$,

$$
S(u)
=
\frac12+
\psi\left(\frac{u+1}{4}\right)
-
\psi\left(\frac{u+3}{4}\right).
$$

Endpoint conventions must be checked at $u\in\mathbb Z$ and at $u\equiv 1,3\pmod 4$.

**Lemma H3: Balanced sawtooth formula.**
Status: proposed, not proved.

For $X=R^2\ge 1$, $y=\lfloor\sqrt X\rfloor$, and $P(X)=N(\sqrt X)-\pi X$,

$$
P(X)
=
-4\sum_{a\le y}\chi_4(a)\psi(X/a)
+
4\sum_{b\le y}
\left[
\psi\left(\frac{X/b+1}{4}\right)
-
\psi\left(\frac{X/b+3}{4}\right)
\right]
+
O(1).
$$

This is the corrected version of Gemini's proposed formula, with $a,b\le y=\lfloor\sqrt X\rfloor$ rather than informal $a,b\le R$. It must not be marked proved until the $O(1)$ residual is derived.

**Lemma H4: Vaaler truncation for balanced hyperbola sums.**
Status: proposed technical target.

For truncation height $H$, express each sawtooth term in H3 as a finite Fourier sum plus a controlled residual. The output should have the schematic form

$$
P(X)
=
\sum_{1\le |h|\le H}\alpha_h
\sum_{a\le y}\chi_4(a)e(hX/a)
+
\sum_{1\le |h|\le H}\beta_h
\sum_{b\le y}
\left[
e\left(\frac{h(X/b+1)}{4}\right)
-
e\left(\frac{h(X/b+3)}{4}\right)
\right]
+
\mathcal E(X,H),
$$

where $\alpha_h,\beta_h\ll 1/|h|$, and $\mathcal E(X,H)$ is explicitly bounded.

**Lemma H5: Dyadic exponential-sum criterion.**
Status: target.

Find explicit conditions on dyadic estimates of the form

$$
\sum_{h\sim H_0}\frac{1}{h}
\sum_{d\sim D}c_d e(hX/d)
$$

that imply

$$
P(X)\ll_\epsilon X^{1/4+\epsilon}.
$$

This criterion should state the allowed ranges of $D,H_0$, the coefficient class $c_d$, and the loss permitted after summing over dyadic blocks.

**Lemma B1: Smoothed Poisson--Bessel sanity check.**
Status: standard/proposed for proof.

For a fixed smooth compactly supported radial mollifier $\rho$, prove the smoothed Poisson--Bessel formula and sandwich inequality, then recover

$$
E(R)\ll R^{2/3}
$$

from the trivial bound on dyadic radial sums. This is not the selected main route but should be retained as a calibration test.

Counterexample checks to run:

1. **Boundary test for H1--H3.**
   Check $X$ in the following classes:

* $0<X<1$,
   * $X=1,2,3,4,5$,
   * $X=n$ a square,
   * $X=n$ not a square,
   * $X$ noninteger near an integer,
   * $R=\sqrt X$ integer and noninteger.

2. **Endpoint convention test for $\psi$.**
   Compare the floor-compatible $\psi(t)=t-\lfloor t\rfloor-1/2$ with the Fourier-centered sawtooth convention at integer arguments. Record exactly where each convention is used.

3. **Numerical test of Gemini's proposed formula.**
   Compute

$$
E(R)-\left[
-4\sum_{a\le \lfloor R\rfloor}\chi_4(a)\psi(R^2/a)
+
4\sum_{b\le \lfloor R\rfloor}
\left(
\psi\left(\frac{R^2/b+1}{4}\right)
-
\psi\left(\frac{R^2/b+3}{4}\right)
\right)
\right]
$$

for many $R$ and verify whether it is uniformly bounded.

4. **Unbalanced versus balanced Vaaler cost.**
   Estimate the residual size when Vaaler is applied to $d\le X$ versus after the hyperbola cut $d\le X^{1/2}$. This should be done symbolically and numerically.

5. **Radial phase false-start guardrail.**
   Record that the Hessian determinant of $R\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ vanishes. Any future claim using generic full-rank two-dimensional stationary phase on this phase should be automatically flagged.

6. **Character-blindness check.**
   For each proposed exponential-sum estimate, mark whether it uses cancellation from $\chi_4$ or only the bound $|\chi_4|\le 1$.

Next round instructions:

**For `gemini_deep_think`:**

Reformulate "character blindness" as a precise dyadic estimate. Specify the coefficient class, the dyadic ranges, and what bound would be needed to reach $X^{1/4+\epsilon}$. Avoid claims that nonzero Hessian alone implies decoupling applicability.

**For `gpt_pro_thinking`:**

Write the unified Round 2 reading packet: arithmetic hyperbola as the selected main route, Bessel smoothing as a calibration route, and the exact gap list H1--H5. Include a short literature-audit checklist for Huxley, Bourgain--Watt, Li--Yang, and ANTEDB.

Confidence:

High confidence in selecting the **balanced arithmetic hyperbola/sawtooth route** as the main Round 2 direction.

High confidence that the Poisson--Bessel route remains useful for smoothing, unsmoothing, and the $R^{2/3}$ sanity check.

Moderate confidence that Gemini's balanced formula is correct up to $O(1)$ after endpoint repair; it still requires proof.

Low confidence that formal Hessian nondegeneracy of $\Phi(h,d)=hX/d$ is enough to invoke modern decoupling or Bombieri--Iwaniec estimates without substantial additional work.

Overall Round 1 judgment: productive, but no theorem improving the Gauss circle bound has been proved. The next round should verify the arithmetic foundation before attempting any high-powered exponential-sum estimate.

## Round 2 Update

Timestamp: 2026-05-31 23:34:11

See `rounds/web-research-test/round_002/judge/judge.md`.

Selected main route:

Continue with the **balanced arithmetic hyperbola/sawtooth route as the main analytic route**, and retain the **smoothed Poisson--Bessel route only as a calibration route**. The active Round 2 judge prompt asks for a Stage C synthesis with selected route, useful fragments, rejected ideas, gaps, lemmas, counterexample checks, next-round tasks, and confidence.

The selected proof skeleton is:

$$
N(\sqrt X)-\pi X
\longrightarrow
\text{symmetric hyperbola identity}
\longrightarrow
\text{balanced sawtooth formula}
\longrightarrow
\text{finite Vaaler expansion}
\longrightarrow
\text{character-aware reciprocal sums}.
$$

Here

$$
X=R^2,\qquad P(X)=N(\sqrt X)-\pi X,
$$

and the target is

$$
P(X)\ll_\epsilon X^{1/4+\epsilon}.
$$

Round 2 made real checkable progress: H1 and H2 should be promoted to **proved**; H3 should be promoted to **plausibly proved / pending independent endpoint audit**; H4 and H5 should be rewritten to incorporate the Leg 2 character transfer

$$
e(h/4)-e(3h/4)=2i\chi_4(h).
$$

No improvement to the Gauss circle exponent has been proved. The result of Round 2 is a cleaner reduction and a sharper target.

Useful fragments by source:

**From `gpt_pro_thinking`:**

The main useful contribution is the explicit derivation of the balanced sawtooth formula. With

$$
\chi=\chi_4,\qquad
T(X)=\sum_{ab\le X}\chi(a),\qquad
S(u)=\sum_{1\le a\le u}\chi(a),\qquad
y=\lfloor X^{1/2}\rfloor,
$$

Round 2 derived

$$
T(X)
=
\sum_{a\le y}\chi(a)\left\lfloor\frac Xa\right\rfloor
+
\sum_{b\le y}S(X/b)
-
yS(y).
$$

It also used

$$
S(u)
=
\left\lfloor\frac{u+3}{4}\right\rfloor
- \left\lfloor\frac{u+1}{4}\right\rfloor
=
\frac12+
\psi\left(\frac{u+1}{4}\right)
-
\psi\left(\frac{u+3}{4}\right),
$$

with the floor-compatible convention

$$
\psi(t)=t-\lfloor t\rfloor-\frac12.
$$

The derived oscillatory part is

$$
W(X)
=
-4\sum_{a\le y}\chi(a)\psi(X/a)
+
4\sum_{b\le y}
\left[
\psi\left(\frac{X/b+1}{4}\right)
-
\psi\left(\frac{X/b+3}{4}\right)
\right].
$$

The exact residual was isolated as

$$
P(X)-W(X)
=
1+
4X\left(\sum_{a\le y}\frac{\chi(a)}{a}-\frac{\pi}{4}\right)
+
2y-2S(y)-4yS(y).
$$

Using the four-case tail estimate

$$
L(1,\chi_4)-\sum_{a\le y}\frac{\chi(a)}{a}
=
\frac{1-2S(y)}{2y}
+
O(y^{-2}),
$$

this gives $P(X)-W(X)=O(1)$ after checking small $y$ and endpoint cases. The uploaded Round 2 material explicitly identifies this residual calculation and the Fejer-weighted Vaaler residual as the major rigorous contribution.

The second useful contribution is the correction that Vaaler truncation does **not** leave only a scalar $O(y/H)$ error. The residual contains Fejer-weighted reciprocal exponential sums of essentially the same type as the main sums, so those residuals must be included in H4/H5. This prevents a standard false proof pattern.

**From `gemini_deep_think`:**

The most useful contribution is the Leg 2 character transfer. In the formal Fourier expansion,

$$
\psi\left(\frac{X/b+1}{4}\right)
-
\psi\left(\frac{X/b+3}{4}\right)
$$

produces the coefficient

$$
e(h/4)-e(3h/4)
=
2i\sin(\pi h/2)
= 2i\chi_4(h).
$$

Thus Leg 1 carries $\chi_4(a)$ on the spatial variable, while Leg 2 carries $\chi_4(h)$ on the frequency variable. The Round 2 review correctly says H4/H5 should be updated to record this rather than treating the second leg as a generic bounded coefficient.

Gemini also correctly withdrew the earlier overclaim that nonzero Hessian alone supplies a decoupling theorem. The continuous phase $\Phi(h,d)=hX/d$ has local nondegeneracy, but global rational collisions and spacing obstructions remain the real Bombieri--Iwaniec difficulty.

**From `gpt_pro_thinking` Stage B review:**

The most useful synthesis is to split H5 into two distinct target families rather than one generic coefficient class. It also correctly downgrades Gemini's "character-blindness barrier" from "proved theorem" to " diagnostic obstruction heuristic."

Rejected or risky ideas:

1. **Reject: H6 as a proved theorem.**
   The claim that every character-blind method strictly requires the Exponent Pair Conjecture is not proved. It is a useful warning about one natural exponent-pair calculation, but it does not rule out all large-sieve, bilinear, spacing, or decoupling variants. Keep H6 only as a diagnostic heuristic. The Stage B review explicitly flags this overclaim.

2. **Reject: "$H$ must be exactly $X^{1/4+\epsilon}$."**
   The correct statement is that $H$ must be at least about $X^{1/4}$ if the zeroth-order Vaaler residual $X^{1/2}/H$ is to be at the conjectural scale. Larger $H$ may be allowed, but it enlarges the frequency range and changes the analytic target.

3. **Reject: treating the two character placements as analytically identical.**
   Leg 1 has a spatial character:

$$
   \sum_{a\sim D}\chi_4(a)e(hX/a).
$$

Leg 2 has a frequency character:

$$
   \sum_{h\sim H_0}\chi_4(h)u_h
   \sum_{b\sim D}e(hX/(4b)).
$$

These are not interchangeable under Cauchy--Schwarz, differencing, completion, or spacing estimates. The Stage B review explicitly warns against collapsing them into a single "symmetric" estimate.

4. **Reject: "exploit Deligne/Weil" from $\chi_4(a)\chi_4(a+q)$ without a complete-sum formulation.**
   Since $\chi_4$ has modulus $4$, shifted products are often just periodic patterns. There may be useful arithmetic structure, but not a deep complete-sum gain until an actual complete sum and modulus are specified.

5. **Reject: generic full-rank stationary phase on the geometric Bessel phase.**
   The earlier guardrail remains: do not apply generic full-rank two-dimensional stationary phase to $R|k|$ or $R\sqrt{ab}$. The Bessel route remains useful for smoothing and the classical $R^{2/3}$ calibration, not as the selected route to a new exponent.

6. **Reject: current-record claims without audit.**
   Li--Yang's arXiv abstract states that their improvement uses Bombieri--Iwaniec, a new first-spacing estimate, and Huxley's second-spacing results. ([arXiv][1]) ANTEDB is a living database for analytic-number-theory exponents, so record-status claims should remain in the literature-audit queue rather than be treated as permanent facts. ([Teorth][2])

Known gaps:

1. **H3 endpoint audit.**
   The balanced sawtooth formula is strongly supported, but before marking it proved in the public lemma bank, the repo should verify all endpoint conventions: $X$ integer, $X$ noninteger near an integer, $X=n^2$, $X=n^2\pm\eta$, and small $y$. The Fourier-centered sawtooth and floor-compatible sawtooth differ at discontinuities.

2. **Exact four-case Gregory tail estimate.**
   The needed estimate

$$
   L(1,\chi_4)-\sum_{a\le y}\frac{\chi_4(a)}{a}
=
\frac{1-2S(y)}{2y}+O(y^{-2})
$$

should be written as an explicit four-case lemma for $y\equiv 0,1,2,3\pmod 4$, with a uniform constant.

3. **Finite Vaaler polynomial conventions.**
   The formal infinite Fourier series gives the clean Leg 2 character transfer. A finite Vaaler polynomial has modified coefficients and a residual majorant. The exact statement must distinguish:

* main Vaaler coefficients;
   * jump/discontinuity behavior;
   * Fejer majorant terms;
   * whether the Leg 2 factor remains exactly $2i\chi_4(h)$ in every nonzero main coefficient.

4. **Fejer residual estimates.**
   The residual is not only $O(X^{1/2}/H)$. It also contains nonzero-frequency sums. The next H5 must include estimates for these residual-weighted sums, or explicitly prove that they are dominated by H5a/H5b.

5. **Dyadic criterion strength.**
   The target

$$
   B_i(H_0,D;X)\ll_\epsilon H_0X^{1/4+\epsilon}
$$

is sufficient but likely very strong. The repo must compare it against known Bombieri--Iwaniec and Li--Yang parameter ranges rather than assuming it is reachable. Li--Yang's stated result improves both the Gauss circle and divisor problems through a new first-spacing estimate combined with Huxley's second-spacing work. ([arXiv][1])

6. **Character exploitation.**
   Every future estimate must be labelled:

* character-aware;
   * character-blind;
   * character only in an $\ell^2$ norm;
   * character used through congruence or correlation structure.

7. **Bessel calibration route.**
   The smoothed Poisson--Bessel formula, sandwich/unsmoothing lemma, and $R^{2/3}$ sanity check should still be proved in the repo, but this remains a secondary track.

New lemmas to add:

**H1. Exact symmetric hyperbola identity.**
Status: proved.

For $X\ge 1$, $y=\lfloor X^{1/2}\rfloor$, and

$$
S(u)=\sum_{1\le a\le u}\chi_4(a),
$$

one has

$$
\sum_{ab\le X}\chi_4(a)
=
\sum_{a\le y}\chi_4(a)\left\lfloor\frac Xa\right\rfloor
+
\sum_{b\le y}S(X/b)
-
yS(y).
$$

Proof: the region $ab\le X$ is covered by $a\le y$ and $b\le y$, because $a>y$ and $b>y$ imply $ab>(y+1)^2>X$. The overlap is $a\le y$, $b\le y$, contributing $yS(y)$.

**H2. Exact periodic formula for $S(u)$.**
Status: proved.

For real $u\ge 0$,

$$
S(u)
=
\left\lfloor\frac{u+3}{4}\right\rfloor
- \left\lfloor\frac{u+1}{4}\right\rfloor
=
\frac12+
\psi\left(\frac{u+1}{4}\right)
-
\psi\left(\frac{u+3}{4}\right),
$$

where $\psi(t)=t-\lfloor t\rfloor-\frac12$.

**H3. Balanced sawtooth formula.**
Status: plausibly proved; pending independent endpoint audit.

For $X\ge 1$, $y=\lfloor X^{1/2}\rfloor$,

$$
P(X)
=
-4\sum_{a\le y}\chi_4(a)\psi(X/a)
+
4\sum_{b\le y}
\left[
\psi\left(\frac{X/b+1}{4}\right)
-
\psi\left(\frac{X/b+3}{4}\right)
\right]
+
O(1).
$$

The exact residual before the final $O(1)$ bound is

$$
P(X)-W(X)
=
1+
4X\left(\sum_{a\le y}\frac{\chi_4(a)}{a}-\frac{\pi}{4}\right)
+
2y-2S(y)-4yS(y).
$$

This should be placed in the best proof draft with a warning: "not final until small cases and discontinuities are checked."

**H4. Finite Vaaler expansion with dual-character bookkeeping.**
Status: proposed technical lemma.

For a valid finite Vaaler approximation,

$$
\psi(t)
=
\sum_{1\le |h|\le H}\alpha_h e(ht)
+
\mathcal R_H(t),
\qquad
\alpha_h\ll \frac1{|h|},
$$

the main terms from H3 are

$$
\sum_{1\le |h|\le H}\alpha_h
\sum_{a\le y}\chi_4(a)e(hX/a)
$$

and

$$
\sum_{1\le |h|\le H}\alpha_h
\left(e(h/4)-e(3h/4)\right)
\sum_{b\le y}e(hX/(4b)).
$$

Since

$$
e(h/4)-e(3h/4)=2i\chi_4(h),
$$

the second main family is frequency-character-twisted. The residual $\mathcal R_H$ must be expanded or bounded with Fejer terms, not discarded as a scalar $O(y/H)$.

**H5a. Spatial-character dyadic target.**
Status: sufficient target, not known.

For $D\le X^{1/2}$, $H_0\le H$, smooth dyadic $w$, and $|u_h|\le 1$, define

$$
B_1(H_0,D;X)
=
\sum_{h\sim H_0}u_h
\sum_{a\sim D}\chi_4(a)w(a/D)e(hX/a).
$$

A sufficient target is

$$
B_1(H_0,D;X)
\ll_\epsilon
H_0X^{1/4+\epsilon}.
$$

**H5b. Frequency-character dyadic target.**
Status: sufficient target, not known.

Define

$$
B_2(H_0,D;X)
=
\sum_{h\sim H_0}u_h\chi_4(h)
\sum_{b\sim D}w(b/D)e(hX/(4b)).
$$

A sufficient target is

$$
B_2(H_0,D;X)
\ll_\epsilon
H_0X^{1/4+\epsilon}.
$$

This is not the same analytic problem as H5a.

**H5r. Fejer-residual dyadic variants.**
Status: required target family.

For the Fejer residual coefficients from Vaaler, formulate parallel dyadic estimates. These may have weights of size $O(1/H)$ rather than $O(1/h)$ and may require absolute values outside some inner sums. The next round should state them exactly.

**H6. Character-blindness diagnostic.**
Status: obstruction heuristic, not proved.

A method is character-blind if, after dyadic decomposition, it replaces $\chi_4(a)$ or $\chi_4(h)$ by coefficient bounds and estimates only untwisted reciprocal phases. Such a method should not be accepted as a route to $X^{1/4+\epsilon}$ unless it states a theorem strong enough to handle the corresponding untwisted divisor-type reciprocal sums. This preserves Gemini's useful warning without asserting a universal impossibility theorem.

**B1. Poisson--Bessel calibration lemma.**
Status: secondary route.

Prove the smoothed Poisson--Bessel formula, the smoothing/unsmoothing sandwich, and the classical $E(R)\ll R^{2/3}$ estimate from trivial radial-sum bounds. This remains a calibration test, not the selected new-exponent route.

Counterexample checks to run:

1. **H3 exact-residual test.**
   Compute $P(X)-W(X)$ and the explicit residual formula for:

* $0<X<1$;
   * $X=1,2,3,4,5$;
   * integer squares;
   * integer nonsquares;
   * $X=n^2\pm 10^{-k}$;
   * $X$ just below and just above an integer.

2. **Sawtooth convention test.**
   Compare the floor-compatible convention

$$
   \psi(t)=t-\lfloor t\rfloor-\frac12
$$

against the Fourier midpoint convention at integer arguments. Record exactly where the finite Vaaler approximation differs.

3. **Leg 2 Fourier transfer test.**
   Verify for finite Vaaler coefficients that the main coefficient factor is exactly

$$
   e(h/4)-e(3h/4)=2i\chi_4(h),
$$

and identify which parts of the residual do or do not inherit the same character factor.

4. **Fejer-residual stress test.**
   Numerically evaluate the Fejer residual sums for structured $X$, especially squares and near-squares, to check whether bounding them by the main H5a/H5b criterion is plausible.

5. **Character-aware versus character-blind test.**
   For each candidate estimate, produce two versions:

* with $\chi_4$ retained;
   * with $|\chi_4|\le 1$ substituted.

Compare the resulting predicted exponent in the critical range $D\sim X^{1/2}$, $H_0\sim X^{1/4}$.

6. **A-process caution test.**
   If applying Weyl differencing to

$$
   \sum_a\chi_4(a)e(f(a)),
$$

compute the shifted character product

$$
   \chi_4(a)\chi_4(a+q)
$$

explicitly by $q\pmod 4$. Do not claim Deligne/Weil-type cancellation unless a genuine complete-sum problem appears.

Next round instructions:

**For `gemini_deep_think`:**

Rewrite H6 as a diagnostic obstruction, not a theorem. Redo the exponent-pair scaling using a precisely named exponent-pair theorem and the standard parameter convention for $f(d)=hX/d$. State what the calculation proves and what it does not prove.

**For `gpt_pro_thinking`:**

Update the reading packet and best proof draft with H1, H2, H3, H4, H5a, H5b, H5r, and H6 as classified above. Then compare H5a/H5b/H5r with the actual Bombieri--Iwaniec and Li--Yang first-spacing framework. The audit should identify whether the current H5 targets are stronger than known technology, equivalent to a known spacing estimate, or malformed.

Confidence:

High confidence in the selected route: balanced arithmetic hyperbola plus Vaaler plus character-aware reciprocal sums.

High confidence in H1 and H2.

Moderate-to-high confidence in H3, conditional on endpoint and small-case audit.

Moderate confidence in the Leg 2 character transfer for the main Fourier terms.

Low confidence that the present H5a/H5b targets are reachable by known methods without substantial new input.

No exponent improvement has been proved in Round 2. The concrete gain is a cleaner, balanced reduction and a more accurate analytic target.

See `rounds/web-research-test/round_001/judge/judge.md`.

Selected main route:

Adopt a **two-track decomposition, with the arithmetic hyperbola/sawtooth route as the main analytic route and the smoothed Poisson--Bessel route as a normalization and sanity-check route**.

The main Round 2 objective should not be "prove the conjecture." It should be to produce a verified, endpoint-safe reduction from

$$
E(R)=N(R)-\pi R^2
$$

to balanced dyadic sums coming from the identity

$$
r_2(n)=4\sum_{d\mid n}\chi_4(d),
$$

with $X=R^2$ and target

$$
P(X):=N(\sqrt X)-\pi X=O_\epsilon(X^{1/4+\epsilon}).
$$

The selected analytic route is:

1. Prove an exact **symmetric Dirichlet hyperbola identity** for

$$
T(X):=\sum_{ab\le X}\chi_4(a),
\qquad
N(\sqrt X)=1+4T(X).
$$

2. Convert this identity into sawtooth terms using

$$
\psi(t)=t-\lfloor t\rfloor-\frac12
$$

with explicit endpoint conventions.

3. Apply Vaaler truncation only after the hyperbola cut, so the sums have length about $\sqrt X$ rather than $X$.

4. Derive the exact dyadic exponential-sum target, expected to involve sums of the schematic form

$$
\sum_{h\sim H}\frac{1}{h}
\sum_{d\sim D} c_d e\left(\frac{hX}{d}\right),
\qquad D\le X^{1/2},
$$

with $c_d$ equal either to $\chi_4(d)$ or to coefficients arising from the second hyperbola leg.

Useful fragments by source:

**From `gpt_pro_thinking`:**

The strongest contribution is the normalization into two complementary forms: a smoothed Poisson--Bessel decomposition and an arithmetic sawtooth decomposition using $r_2(n)=4\sum_{d\mid n}\chi_4(d)$. This is the right first-round foundation. The Poisson--Bessel side should remain in the repo because it gives a checkable smoothing/unsmoothing framework and recovers the classical $R^{2/3}$ estimate from trivial radial-sum bounds.

The proposed conditional benchmark

$$
A_M(R)
=
\sum_{k\ne 0}w(|k|/M)e(R|k|)
\ll_\epsilon M^{3/2}R^\epsilon
$$

is useful as a diagnostic criterion, not as a likely direct proof route. It quantifies what type of cancellation the smoothed geometric formulation would need.

The arithmetic identity

$$
P(X)
=
-4\sum_{d\le X}\chi_4(d)\psi(X/d)+O(1)
$$

is valuable as a compact exact reduction, but it should not be the final analytic form for Vaaler truncation. Before estimation, the sum should be shortened by the Dirichlet hyperbola method.

The literature-status discipline is also valuable: record Huxley, Bourgain--Watt, Li--Yang, and ANTEDB separately, and do not use any record exponent as a black-box dependency until the theorem statement and hypotheses are checked.

**From `gemini_deep_think`:**

The most useful mathematical warning is that the raw geometric phase

$$
R\sqrt{x^2+y^2}
$$

and the homogeneous model phase

$$
R\sqrt{ab}
$$

have rank-deficient Hessian. Therefore any proposed proof that applies a generic full-rank two-dimensional stationary phase or decoupling theorem directly to these phases is invalid.

The proposed symmetric hyperbola route is also useful. The exact formula as stated by Gemini should not be marked proved, but the idea of replacing the length-$X$ sawtooth sum with a balanced hyperbola decomposition is correct and should become the main Round 2 task. Gemini's review also correctly flags the analytic cost of applying Vaaler directly to the unbalanced $d\le X$ identity.

Gemini's "character blindness" warning is worth preserving as a gap: after reduction to exponential sums, one must know whether $\chi_4$ is actually being exploited or merely discarded by absolute values. However, this warning needs to be converted into precise coefficient classes and estimates.

**From `gpt_pro_thinking` Stage B review:**

The review correctly demotes Gemini's exact hyperbola formula from "proved" to "proposed." It also gives the right next-step decomposition: split the hyperbola assertion into smaller lemmas H1--H4, separating exact counting, periodic partial sums, main-term cancellation, and Vaaler truncation.

Rejected or risky ideas:

1. **Reject as proved: Gemini's exact hyperbola formula.**
   The formula

$$
E(R)
=
-4\sum_{a\le R}\chi_4(a)\psi(R^2/a)
+
4\sum_{b\le R}
\left[
\psi\left(\frac{R^2/b+1}{4}\right)
-
\psi\left(\frac{R^2/b+3}{4}\right)
\right]
+
O(1)
$$

is plausible in spirit, but it was not proved in Round 1. It must be derived from an exact hyperbola identity with $y=\lfloor \sqrt X\rfloor$, explicit endpoint conventions, and a verified bounded residual.

2. **Reject: "nonzero Hessian unlocks modern decoupling" as a theorem.**
   For the phase

$$
\Phi(h,d)=\frac{hX}{d},
$$

the formal Hessian determinant in continuous variables is nonzero. That calculation is correct, but it does not by itself imply that Bourgain--Watt, Bombieri--Iwaniec, or any decoupling theorem applies. The needed theorem, coefficient hypotheses, dyadic ranges, spacing conditions, and loss factors must be stated.

3. **Reject: abandoning Bessel methods entirely.**
   The Bessel route is risky as a direct source of new exponents because of radial degeneracy. It is still useful for smoothing, unsmoothing, checking notation, and recovering the classical $R^{2/3}$ sanity bound.

4. **Reject: "smoothing artificially erases point-mass spikes."**
   Smoothing without an unsmoothing argument is dangerous. Standard smoothing with a sandwich lemma is legitimate and should remain in the technical toolkit.

5. **Treat as risky: the radial benchmark $A_M(R)\ll M^{3/2}R^\epsilon$.**
   It is a clean sufficient condition, but not a near-term lemma. The Hessian warning suggests that generic two-dimensional nondegenerate tools are unavailable for this raw radial phase.

Known gaps:

1. **Endpoint conventions for $\psi$.**
   The identity

$$
\lfloor t\rfloor=t-\psi(t)-\frac12
$$

is exact if $\psi(t)=t-\lfloor t\rfloor-\frac12$, including $\psi(n)=-1/2$ at integers. Fourier series and Vaaler approximations usually behave differently at discontinuities. This must be recorded explicitly.

2. **Exact symmetric hyperbola identity.**
   The repo needs a proved identity for

$$
T(X)=\sum_{ab\le X}\chi_4(a)
$$

with $y=\lfloor\sqrt X\rfloor$:

$$
T(X)
=
\sum_{a\le y}\chi_4(a)\left\lfloor\frac Xa\right\rfloor
+
\sum_{b\le y}S(X/b)
-
yS(y),
$$

where

$$
S(u)=\sum_{a\le u}\chi_4(a).
$$

3. **Periodic partial-sum formula.**
   One needs a fully checked formula for $S(u)$, for real $u$, including integer endpoints. A likely exact formula is

$$
S(u)
=
\left\lfloor\frac{u+3}{4}\right\rfloor
- \left\lfloor\frac{u+1}{4}\right\rfloor
=
\frac12+
\psi\left(\frac{u+1}{4}\right)
-
\psi\left(\frac{u+3}{4}\right),
$$

with the same floor-compatible convention for $\psi$.

4. **Main-term cancellation after the symmetric cut.**
   After substituting the floor and $S(u)$ formulas, the nonoscillatory terms must be shown to equal $\pi X/4+O(1)$ at the level of $T(X)$. This is the critical algebraic step behind Gemini's proposed formula.

5. **Vaaler truncation error.**
   The truncation error must be derived with full dependence on the length $D$, Fourier height $H$, and endpoint/jump terms. The heuristic "error is length divided by $H$" is not enough.

6. **Dyadic parameter map.**
   The route needs a precise map from the hyperbola formula to dyadic ranges $D,H,T$, with $T=X$, $D\le X^{1/2}$, and $H$ chosen according to the actual Vaaler error. This must precede any appeal to Bombieri--Iwaniec-type estimates.

7. **Coefficient handling.**
   The role of $\chi_4(d)$ must be explicit. The repo should distinguish estimates that exploit the character from estimates that merely bound $|c_d|\le 1$.

8. **Literature audit.**
   Record-exponent claims should be audited from primary sources before being treated as dependencies.

New lemmas to add:

**Lemma H1: Exact symmetric hyperbola identity.**
Status: proposed, expected standard.

For $X\ge 1$, set $y=\lfloor\sqrt X\rfloor$ and

$$
S(u)=\sum_{1\le a\le u}\chi_4(a).
$$

Then

$$
\sum_{ab\le X}\chi_4(a)
=
\sum_{a\le y}\chi_4(a)\left\lfloor\frac Xa\right\rfloor
+
\sum_{b\le y}S(X/b)
-
yS(y).
$$

This should be proved by covering the region $ab\le X$ by the union of $a\le y$ and $b\le y$, noting that no pair with $a>y$ and $b>y$ can satisfy $ab\le X$.

**Lemma H2: Exact periodic formula for $S(u)$.**
Status: proposed, elementary.

For real $u\ge 0$,

$$
S(u)
=
\left\lfloor\frac{u+3}{4}\right\rfloor
- \left\lfloor\frac{u+1}{4}\right\rfloor.
$$

Equivalently, with $\psi(t)=t-\lfloor t\rfloor-\frac12$,

$$
S(u)
=
\frac12+
\psi\left(\frac{u+1}{4}\right)
-
\psi\left(\frac{u+3}{4}\right).
$$

Endpoint conventions must be checked at $u\in\mathbb Z$ and at $u\equiv 1,3\pmod 4$.

**Lemma H3: Balanced sawtooth formula.**
Status: proposed, not proved.

For $X=R^2\ge 1$, $y=\lfloor\sqrt X\rfloor$, and $P(X)=N(\sqrt X)-\pi X$,

$$
P(X)
=
-4\sum_{a\le y}\chi_4(a)\psi(X/a)
+
4\sum_{b\le y}
\left[
\psi\left(\frac{X/b+1}{4}\right)
-
\psi\left(\frac{X/b+3}{4}\right)
\right]
+
O(1).
$$

This is the corrected version of Gemini's proposed formula, with $a,b\le y=\lfloor\sqrt X\rfloor$ rather than informal $a,b\le R$. It must not be marked proved until the $O(1)$ residual is derived.

**Lemma H4: Vaaler truncation for balanced hyperbola sums.**
Status: proposed technical target.

For truncation height $H$, express each sawtooth term in H3 as a finite Fourier sum plus a controlled residual. The output should have the schematic form

$$
P(X)
=
\sum_{1\le |h|\le H}\alpha_h
\sum_{a\le y}\chi_4(a)e(hX/a)
+
\sum_{1\le |h|\le H}\beta_h
\sum_{b\le y}
\left[
e\left(\frac{h(X/b+1)}{4}\right)
-
e\left(\frac{h(X/b+3)}{4}\right)
\right]
+
\mathcal E(X,H),
$$

where $\alpha_h,\beta_h\ll 1/|h|$, and $\mathcal E(X,H)$ is explicitly bounded.

**Lemma H5: Dyadic exponential-sum criterion.**
Status: target.

Find explicit conditions on dyadic estimates of the form

$$
\sum_{h\sim H_0}\frac{1}{h}
\sum_{d\sim D}c_d e(hX/d)
$$

that imply

$$
P(X)\ll_\epsilon X^{1/4+\epsilon}.
$$

This criterion should state the allowed ranges of $D,H_0$, the coefficient class $c_d$, and the loss permitted after summing over dyadic blocks.

**Lemma B1: Smoothed Poisson--Bessel sanity check.**
Status: standard/proposed for proof.

For a fixed smooth compactly supported radial mollifier $\rho$, prove the smoothed Poisson--Bessel formula and sandwich inequality, then recover

$$
E(R)\ll R^{2/3}
$$

from the trivial bound on dyadic radial sums. This is not the selected main route but should be retained as a calibration test.

Counterexample checks to run:

1. **Boundary test for H1--H3.**
   Check $X$ in the following classes:

* $0<X<1$,
   * $X=1,2,3,4,5$,
   * $X=n$ a square,
   * $X=n$ not a square,
   * $X$ noninteger near an integer,
   * $R=\sqrt X$ integer and noninteger.

2. **Endpoint convention test for $\psi$.**
   Compare the floor-compatible $\psi(t)=t-\lfloor t\rfloor-1/2$ with the Fourier-centered sawtooth convention at integer arguments. Record exactly where each convention is used.

3. **Numerical test of Gemini's proposed formula.**
   Compute

$$
E(R)-\left[
-4\sum_{a\le \lfloor R\rfloor}\chi_4(a)\psi(R^2/a)
+
4\sum_{b\le \lfloor R\rfloor}
\left(
\psi\left(\frac{R^2/b+1}{4}\right)
-
\psi\left(\frac{R^2/b+3}{4}\right)
\right)
\right]
$$

for many $R$ and verify whether it is uniformly bounded.

4. **Unbalanced versus balanced Vaaler cost.**
   Estimate the residual size when Vaaler is applied to $d\le X$ versus after the hyperbola cut $d\le X^{1/2}$. This should be done symbolically and numerically.

5. **Radial phase false-start guardrail.**
   Record that the Hessian determinant of $R\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ vanishes. Any future claim using generic full-rank two-dimensional stationary phase on this phase should be automatically flagged.

6. **Character-blindness check.**
   For each proposed exponential-sum estimate, mark whether it uses cancellation from $\chi_4$ or only the bound $|\chi_4|\le 1$.

Next round instructions:

**For `gemini_deep_think`:**

Reformulate "character blindness" as a precise dyadic estimate. Specify the coefficient class, the dyadic ranges, and what bound would be needed to reach $X^{1/4+\epsilon}$. Avoid claims that nonzero Hessian alone implies decoupling applicability.

**For `gpt_pro_thinking`:**

Write the unified Round 2 reading packet: arithmetic hyperbola as the selected main route, Bessel smoothing as a calibration route, and the exact gap list H1--H5. Include a short literature-audit checklist for Huxley, Bourgain--Watt, Li--Yang, and ANTEDB.

Confidence:

High confidence in selecting the **balanced arithmetic hyperbola/sawtooth route** as the main Round 2 direction.

High confidence that the Poisson--Bessel route remains useful for smoothing, unsmoothing, and the $R^{2/3}$ sanity check.

Moderate confidence that Gemini's balanced formula is correct up to $O(1)$ after endpoint repair; it still requires proof.

Low confidence that formal Hessian nondegeneracy of $\Phi(h,d)=hX/d$ is enough to invoke modern decoupling or Bombieri--Iwaniec estimates without substantial additional work.

Overall Round 1 judgment: productive, but no theorem improving the Gauss circle bound has been proved. The next round should verify the arithmetic foundation before attempting any high-powered exponential-sum estimate.

## Round 2 Update

Timestamp: 2026-05-31 23:34:11

See `rounds/web-research-test/round_002/judge/judge.md`.

Selected main route:

Continue with the **balanced arithmetic hyperbola/sawtooth route as the main analytic route**, and retain the **smoothed Poisson--Bessel route only as a calibration route**. The active Round 2 judge prompt asks for a Stage C synthesis with selected route, useful fragments, rejected ideas, gaps, lemmas, counterexample checks, next-round tasks, and confidence.

The selected proof skeleton is:

$$
N(\sqrt X)-\pi X
\longrightarrow
\text{symmetric hyperbola identity}
\longrightarrow
\text{balanced sawtooth formula}
\longrightarrow
\text{finite Vaaler expansion}
\longrightarrow
\text{character-aware reciprocal sums}.
$$

Here

$$
X=R^2,\qquad P(X)=N(\sqrt X)-\pi X,
$$

and the target is

$$
P(X)\ll_\epsilon X^{1/4+\epsilon}.
$$

Round 2 made real checkable progress: H1 and H2 should be promoted to **proved**; H3 should be promoted to **plausibly proved / pending independent endpoint audit**; H4 and H5 should be rewritten to incorporate the Leg 2 character transfer

$$
e(h/4)-e(3h/4)=2i\chi_4(h).
$$

No improvement to the Gauss circle exponent has been proved. The result of Round 2 is a cleaner reduction and a sharper target.

Useful fragments by source:

**From `gpt_pro_thinking`:**

The main useful contribution is the explicit derivation of the balanced sawtooth formula. With

$$
\chi=\chi_4,\qquad
T(X)=\sum_{ab\le X}\chi(a),\qquad
S(u)=\sum_{1\le a\le u}\chi(a),\qquad
y=\lfloor X^{1/2}\rfloor,
$$

Round 2 derived

$$
T(X)
=
\sum_{a\le y}\chi(a)\left\lfloor\frac Xa\right\rfloor
+
\sum_{b\le y}S(X/b)
-
yS(y).
$$

It also used

$$
S(u)
=
\left\lfloor\frac{u+3}{4}\right\rfloor
- \left\lfloor\frac{u+1}{4}\right\rfloor
=
\frac12+
\psi\left(\frac{u+1}{4}\right)
-
\psi\left(\frac{u+3}{4}\right),
$$

with the floor-compatible convention

$$
\psi(t)=t-\lfloor t\rfloor-\frac12.
$$

The derived oscillatory part is

$$
W(X)
=
-4\sum_{a\le y}\chi(a)\psi(X/a)
+
4\sum_{b\le y}
\left[
\psi\left(\frac{X/b+1}{4}\right)
-
\psi\left(\frac{X/b+3}{4}\right)
\right].
$$

The exact residual was isolated as

$$
P(X)-W(X)
=
1+
4X\left(\sum_{a\le y}\frac{\chi(a)}{a}-\frac{\pi}{4}\right)
+
2y-2S(y)-4yS(y).
$$

Using the four-case tail estimate

$$
L(1,\chi_4)-\sum_{a\le y}\frac{\chi(a)}{a}
=
\frac{1-2S(y)}{2y}
+
O(y^{-2}),
$$

this gives $P(X)-W(X)=O(1)$ after checking small $y$ and endpoint cases. The uploaded Round 2 material explicitly identifies this residual calculation and the Fejer-weighted Vaaler residual as the major rigorous contribution.

The second useful contribution is the correction that Vaaler truncation does **not** leave only a scalar $O(y/H)$ error. The residual contains Fejer-weighted reciprocal exponential sums of essentially the same type as the main sums, so those residuals must be included in H4/H5. This prevents a standard false proof pattern.

**From `gemini_deep_think`:**

The most useful contribution is the Leg 2 character transfer. In the formal Fourier expansion,

$$
\psi\left(\frac{X/b+1}{4}\right)
-
\psi\left(\frac{X/b+3}{4}\right)
$$

produces the coefficient

$$
e(h/4)-e(3h/4)
=
2i\sin(\pi h/2)
= 2i\chi_4(h).
$$

Thus Leg 1 carries $\chi_4(a)$ on the spatial variable, while Leg 2 carries $\chi_4(h)$ on the frequency variable. The Round 2 review correctly says H4/H5 should be updated to record this rather than treating the second leg as a generic bounded coefficient.

Gemini also correctly withdrew the earlier overclaim that nonzero Hessian alone supplies a decoupling theorem. The continuous phase $\Phi(h,d)=hX/d$ has local nondegeneracy, but global rational collisions and spacing obstructions remain the real Bombieri--Iwaniec difficulty.

**From `gpt_pro_thinking` Stage B review:**

The most useful synthesis is to split H5 into two distinct target families rather than one generic coefficient class. It also correctly downgrades Gemini's "character-blindness barrier" from "proved theorem" to " diagnostic obstruction heuristic."

Rejected or risky ideas:

1. **Reject: H6 as a proved theorem.**
   The claim that every character-blind method strictly requires the Exponent Pair Conjecture is not proved. It is a useful warning about one natural exponent-pair calculation, but it does not rule out all large-sieve, bilinear, spacing, or decoupling variants. Keep H6 only as a diagnostic heuristic. The Stage B review explicitly flags this overclaim.

2. **Reject: "$H$ must be exactly $X^{1/4+\epsilon}$."**
   The correct statement is that $H$ must be at least about $X^{1/4}$ if the zeroth-order Vaaler residual $X^{1/2}/H$ is to be at the conjectural scale. Larger $H$ may be allowed, but it enlarges the frequency range and changes the analytic target.

3. **Reject: treating the two character placements as analytically identical.**
   Leg 1 has a spatial character:

$$
   \sum_{a\sim D}\chi_4(a)e(hX/a).
$$

Leg 2 has a frequency character:

$$
   \sum_{h\sim H_0}\chi_4(h)u_h
   \sum_{b\sim D}e(hX/(4b)).
$$

These are not interchangeable under Cauchy--Schwarz, differencing, completion, or spacing estimates. The Stage B review explicitly warns against collapsing them into a single "symmetric" estimate.

4. **Reject: "exploit Deligne/Weil" from $\chi_4(a)\chi_4(a+q)$ without a complete-sum formulation.**
   Since $\chi_4$ has modulus $4$, shifted products are often just periodic patterns. There may be useful arithmetic structure, but not a deep complete-sum gain until an actual complete sum and modulus are specified.

5. **Reject: generic full-rank stationary phase on the geometric Bessel phase.**
   The earlier guardrail remains: do not apply generic full-rank two-dimensional stationary phase to $R|k|$ or $R\sqrt{ab}$. The Bessel route remains useful for smoothing and the classical $R^{2/3}$ calibration, not as the selected route to a new exponent.

6. **Reject: current-record claims without audit.**
   Li--Yang's arXiv abstract states that their improvement uses Bombieri--Iwaniec, a new first-spacing estimate, and Huxley's second-spacing results. ([arXiv][1]) ANTEDB is a living database for analytic-number-theory exponents, so record-status claims should remain in the literature-audit queue rather than be treated as permanent facts. ([Teorth][2])

Known gaps:

1. **H3 endpoint audit.**
   The balanced sawtooth formula is strongly supported, but before marking it proved in the public lemma bank, the repo should verify all endpoint conventions: $X$ integer, $X$ noninteger near an integer, $X=n^2$, $X=n^2\pm\eta$, and small $y$. The Fourier-centered sawtooth and floor-compatible sawtooth differ at discontinuities.

2. **Exact four-case Gregory tail estimate.**
   The needed estimate

$$
   L(1,\chi_4)-\sum_{a\le y}\frac{\chi_4(a)}{a}
=
\frac{1-2S(y)}{2y}+O(y^{-2})
$$

should be written as an explicit four-case lemma for $y\equiv 0,1,2,3\pmod 4$, with a uniform constant.

3. **Finite Vaaler polynomial conventions.**
   The formal infinite Fourier series gives the clean Leg 2 character transfer. A finite Vaaler polynomial has modified coefficients and a residual majorant. The exact statement must distinguish:

* main Vaaler coefficients;
   * jump/discontinuity behavior;
   * Fejer majorant terms;
   * whether the Leg 2 factor remains exactly $2i\chi_4(h)$ in every nonzero main coefficient.

4. **Fejer residual estimates.**
   The residual is not only $O(X^{1/2}/H)$. It also contains nonzero-frequency sums. The next H5 must include estimates for these residual-weighted sums, or explicitly prove that they are dominated by H5a/H5b.

5. **Dyadic criterion strength.**
   The target

$$
   B_i(H_0,D;X)\ll_\epsilon H_0X^{1/4+\epsilon}
$$

is sufficient but likely very strong. The repo must compare it against known Bombieri--Iwaniec and Li--Yang parameter ranges rather than assuming it is reachable. Li--Yang's stated result improves both the Gauss circle and divisor problems through a new first-spacing estimate combined with Huxley's second-spacing work. ([arXiv][1])

6. **Character exploitation.**
   Every future estimate must be labelled:

* character-aware;
   * character-blind;
   * character only in an $\ell^2$ norm;
   * character used through congruence or correlation structure.

7. **Bessel calibration route.**
   The smoothed Poisson--Bessel formula, sandwich/unsmoothing lemma, and $R^{2/3}$ sanity check should still be proved in the repo, but this remains a secondary track.

New lemmas to add:

**H1. Exact symmetric hyperbola identity.**
Status: proved.

For $X\ge 1$, $y=\lfloor X^{1/2}\rfloor$, and

$$
S(u)=\sum_{1\le a\le u}\chi_4(a),
$$

one has

$$
\sum_{ab\le X}\chi_4(a)
=
\sum_{a\le y}\chi_4(a)\left\lfloor\frac Xa\right\rfloor
+
\sum_{b\le y}S(X/b)
-
yS(y).
$$

Proof: the region $ab\le X$ is covered by $a\le y$ and $b\le y$, because $a>y$ and $b>y$ imply $ab>(y+1)^2>X$. The overlap is $a\le y$, $b\le y$, contributing $yS(y)$.

**H2. Exact periodic formula for $S(u)$.**
Status: proved.

For real $u\ge 0$,

$$
S(u)
=
\left\lfloor\frac{u+3}{4}\right\rfloor
- \left\lfloor\frac{u+1}{4}\right\rfloor
=
\frac12+
\psi\left(\frac{u+1}{4}\right)
-
\psi\left(\frac{u+3}{4}\right),
$$

where $\psi(t)=t-\lfloor t\rfloor-\frac12$.

**H3. Balanced sawtooth formula.**
Status: plausibly proved; pending independent endpoint audit.

For $X\ge 1$, $y=\lfloor X^{1/2}\rfloor$,

$$
P(X)
=
-4\sum_{a\le y}\chi_4(a)\psi(X/a)
+
4\sum_{b\le y}
\left[
\psi\left(\frac{X/b+1}{4}\right)
-
\psi\left(\frac{X/b+3}{4}\right)
\right]
+
O(1).
$$

The exact residual before the final $O(1)$ bound is

$$
P(X)-W(X)
=
1+
4X\left(\sum_{a\le y}\frac{\chi_4(a)}{a}-\frac{\pi}{4}\right)
+
2y-2S(y)-4yS(y).
$$

This should be placed in the best proof draft with a warning: "not final until small cases and discontinuities are checked."

**H4. Finite Vaaler expansion with dual-character bookkeeping.**
Status: proposed technical lemma.

For a valid finite Vaaler approximation,

$$
\psi(t)
=
\sum_{1\le |h|\le H}\alpha_h e(ht)
+
\mathcal R_H(t),
\qquad
\alpha_h\ll \frac1{|h|},
$$

the main terms from H3 are

$$
\sum_{1\le |h|\le H}\alpha_h
\sum_{a\le y}\chi_4(a)e(hX/a)
$$

and

$$
\sum_{1\le |h|\le H}\alpha_h
\left(e(h/4)-e(3h/4)\right)
\sum_{b\le y}e(hX/(4b)).
$$

Since

$$
e(h/4)-e(3h/4)=2i\chi_4(h),
$$

the second main family is frequency-character-twisted. The residual $\mathcal R_H$ must be expanded or bounded with Fejer terms, not discarded as a scalar $O(y/H)$.

**H5a. Spatial-character dyadic target.**
Status: sufficient target, not known.

For $D\le X^{1/2}$, $H_0\le H$, smooth dyadic $w$, and $|u_h|\le 1$, define

$$
B_1(H_0,D;X)
=
\sum_{h\sim H_0}u_h
\sum_{a\sim D}\chi_4(a)w(a/D)e(hX/a).
$$

A sufficient target is

$$
B_1(H_0,D;X)
\ll_\epsilon
H_0X^{1/4+\epsilon}.
$$

**H5b. Frequency-character dyadic target.**
Status: sufficient target, not known.

Define

$$
B_2(H_0,D;X)
=
\sum_{h\sim H_0}u_h\chi_4(h)
\sum_{b\sim D}w(b/D)e(hX/(4b)).
$$

A sufficient target is

$$
B_2(H_0,D;X)
\ll_\epsilon
H_0X^{1/4+\epsilon}.
$$

This is not the same analytic problem as H5a.

**H5r. Fejer-residual dyadic variants.**
Status: required target family.

For the Fejer residual coefficients from Vaaler, formulate parallel dyadic estimates. These may have weights of size $O(1/H)$ rather than $O(1/h)$ and may require absolute values outside some inner sums. The next round should state them exactly.

**H6. Character-blindness diagnostic.**
Status: obstruction heuristic, not proved.

A method is character-blind if, after dyadic decomposition, it replaces $\chi_4(a)$ or $\chi_4(h)$ by coefficient bounds and estimates only untwisted reciprocal phases. Such a method should not be accepted as a route to $X^{1/4+\epsilon}$ unless it states a theorem strong enough to handle the corresponding untwisted divisor-type reciprocal sums. This preserves Gemini's useful warning without asserting a universal impossibility theorem.

**B1. Poisson--Bessel calibration lemma.**
Status: secondary route.

Prove the smoothed Poisson--Bessel formula, the smoothing/unsmoothing sandwich, and the classical $E(R)\ll R^{2/3}$ estimate from trivial radial-sum bounds. This remains a calibration test, not the selected new-exponent route.

Counterexample checks to run:

1. **H3 exact-residual test.**
   Compute $P(X)-W(X)$ and the explicit residual formula for:

* $0<X<1$;
   * $X=1,2,3,4,5$;
   * integer squares;
   * integer nonsquares;
   * $X=n^2\pm 10^{-k}$;
   * $X$ just below and just above an integer.

2. **Sawtooth convention test.**
   Compare the floor-compatible convention

$$
   \psi(t)=t-\lfloor t\rfloor-\frac12
$$

against the Fourier midpoint convention at integer arguments. Record exactly where the finite Vaaler approximation differs.

3. **Leg 2 Fourier transfer test.**
   Verify for finite Vaaler coefficients that the main coefficient factor is exactly

$$
   e(h/4)-e(3h/4)=2i\chi_4(h),
$$

and identify which parts of the residual do or do not inherit the same character factor.

4. **Fejer-residual stress test.**
   Numerically evaluate the Fejer residual sums for structured $X$, especially squares and near-squares, to check whether bounding them by the main H5a/H5b criterion is plausible.

5. **Character-aware versus character-blind test.**
   For each candidate estimate, produce two versions:

* with $\chi_4$ retained;
   * with $|\chi_4|\le 1$ substituted.

Compare the resulting predicted exponent in the critical range $D\sim X^{1/2}$, $H_0\sim X^{1/4}$.

6. **A-process caution test.**
   If applying Weyl differencing to

$$
   \sum_a\chi_4(a)e(f(a)),
$$

compute the shifted character product

$$
   \chi_4(a)\chi_4(a+q)
$$

explicitly by $q\pmod 4$. Do not claim Deligne/Weil-type cancellation unless a genuine complete-sum problem appears.

Next round instructions:

**For `gemini_deep_think`:**

Rewrite H6 as a diagnostic obstruction, not a theorem. Redo the exponent-pair scaling using a precisely named exponent-pair theorem and the standard parameter convention for $f(d)=hX/d$. State what the calculation proves and what it does not prove.

**For `gpt_pro_thinking`:**

Update the reading packet and best proof draft with H1, H2, H3, H4, H5a, H5b, H5r, and H6 as classified above. Then compare H5a/H5b/H5r with the actual Bombieri--Iwaniec and Li--Yang first-spacing framework. The audit should identify whether the current H5 targets are stronger than known technology, equivalent to a known spacing estimate, or malformed.

Confidence:

High confidence in the selected route: balanced arithmetic hyperbola plus Vaaler plus character-aware reciprocal sums.

High confidence in H1 and H2.

Moderate-to-high confidence in H3, conditional on endpoint and small-case audit.

Moderate confidence in the Leg 2 character transfer for the main Fourier terms.

Low confidence that the present H5a/H5b targets are reachable by known methods without substantial new input.

No exponent improvement has been proved in Round 2. The concrete gain is a cleaner, balanced reduction and a more accurate analytic target.

## Outputs To Review

--- OUTPUT FROM gemini_deep_think ---
## 1. Summary

Following the Judge's specific Round 2 instructions and the revised constraints for research-mode output, I have substantially expanded and recalibrated my analysis of the analytical barriers facing the Gauss Circle Problem error term $P(X)$. In this response, I reframe previous strict impossibility claims as precise, conditionally calibrated diagnostic heuristics.

Specifically, I formalize the **1D Exponent-Pair Obstruction (Lemma H6)**. By executing a rigorous parameter scaling using the standard Graham-Kolesnik derivative conventions on the Type I dyadic target, I demonstrate that bounding the spatial variable via classical 1D techniques while trivially summing over the frequency variable forces a steep theoretical requirement. Under the stated character-blind reduction and trivial summation over $h$, the required bound appears to force the exponent-pair-type condition $p+2q \le 1$ at the critical Vaaler endpoint.

Additionally, to understand how one might bypass this 1D barrier by actively exploiting the spatial character $\chi_4(d)$, I analyze the standard Weyl differencing step (the A-process) used in exponential sum dispersion. This reveals a significant structural obstacle: the **A-Process Modulus Degeneracy (Lemma H7)**. Because the character $\chi_4$ has a fixed modulus of 4 and is supported exclusively on odd integers, the shifted character weight $\chi_4(d)\chi_4(d+q)$ degenerates into a non-oscillatory constant on its parity sublattices. Thus, an initial Cauchy-Schwarz smoothing step risks converting the character-aware sum back into a character-blind geometric sum, erasing the exact arithmetic advantage needed to separate the Gauss problem from the Dirichlet Divisor Problem (DDP).

## 2. Main claim or direction

The repository should adopt the revised **Lemma H6** and **Lemma H7** as explicit diagnostic filters to evaluate future analytical proposals.

These diagnostics suggest that any method hoping to unconditionally achieve $P(X) \ll_\epsilon X^{1/4+\epsilon}$ is highly unlikely to succeed if it relies on iterating classical 1D analytical bounds over character-blind sums. Furthermore, methods that attempt to inject character awareness but begin with a spatial Cauchy-Schwarz smoothing step (the standard A-process) face a structural degeneration.

The recommended strategic direction for subsequent rounds is to prioritize:
1. Native 2D double-sum spacing frameworks (e.g., Bombieri-Iwaniec matrices) that extract cross-cancellation over the frequency parameter $h$, bypassing the trivial summation assumption of H6.
2. Sequence-reversing dualizations, explicitly applying the B-process (twisted Poisson summation) *before* Weyl differencing, to map the spatial character into a dual Gauss sum and bypass the modulus degeneracy of H7 entirely.

## 3. Revised H6: diagnostic 1D exponent-pair obstruction

Consider the spatial-character dyadic target formulated in Round 2:
$$
B_1(H_0, D; X) = \sum_{h \sim H_0} u_h \sum_{d \sim D} \chi_4(d) w(d/D) e\left(\frac{hX}{d}\right)
$$
where $|u_h| \le 1$. The Judge's sufficient criterion requires that this dyadic block satisfies the bound $B_1 \ll_\epsilon H_0 X^{1/4+\epsilon}$.

We evaluate the constraints placed on any analytic method that relies on 1D spatial bounds while summing trivially over $h$. The inner sum is $S_h(D) = \sum_{d \sim D} e(f(d))$ with phase $f(d) = hX/d$. Following the standard Graham-Kolesnik derivative conventions, the order of magnitude of the $k$-th derivative is $|f^{(k)}(d)| \asymp \lambda / D^{k-1}$. For the first derivative, $|f'(d)| = hX/d^2 \asymp hX/D^2$, defining our amplitude parameter $\lambda = hX/D^2$.

Applying a classical 1D Exponent Pair $(p,q)$ to the inner sum yields:
$$
|S_h(D)| \ll \lambda^p D^q = \left(\frac{hX}{D^2}\right)^p D^q = h^p X^p D^{q-2p}
$$

Taking absolute values over the outer variable $h \sim H_0$ (the character-blind, trivial summation hypothesis) yields the total block bound:
$$
|B_1| \ll \sum_{h \sim H_0} \left( h^p X^p D^{q-2p} \right) \asymp H_0^{p+1} X^p D^{q-2p}
$$

To achieve the conjectural target, we require $H_0^{p+1} X^p D^{q-2p} \ll H_0 X^{1/4+\epsilon}$. Dividing by $H_0$ gives the condition on the base phase error:
$$
H_0^p X^p D^{q-2p} \ll X^{1/4+\epsilon}
$$

We now test this condition at the most critical dyadic boundary generated by the balanced hyperbola cut, where $D \asymp X^{1/2}$ and $H_0 \asymp X^{1/4}$. Substituting these structural limits gives:
$$
(X^{1/4})^p X^p (X^{1/2})^{q-2p} = X^{p/4 + p + q/2 - p} = X^{p/4 + q/2}
$$

For this upper bound to be controlled by $X^{1/4}$ (ignoring $X^\epsilon$ for the algebraic boundary), we are forced to satisfy the inequality:
$$
\frac{p}{4} + \frac{q}{2} \le \frac{1}{4} \implies p + 2q \le 1
$$

**Under the stated character-blind reduction and trivial summation over h, the required bound appears to force the exponent-pair-type condition $p+2q \le 1$.** Because this limit is the precise mathematical equivalent of the unsolved Exponent Pair Conjecture (which posits that optimal pairs approach $(0, 1/2)$), this heuristic heavily suggests that 1D approaches will stall at the classical DDP barrier.

## 4. Revised H7: A-process modulus degeneracy

To circumvent the H6 barrier, a researcher must actively exploit the character $\chi_4(d)$. The standard analytical gateway to smooth weights and extract exponential cancellation is Weyl differencing (the A-process) via the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Applying this to the inner spatial sum yields:
$$
\left| \sum_{d \sim D} \chi_4(d) w(d/D) e(f(d)) \right|^2 \ll D \sum_q \sum_d \chi_4(d)\chi_4(d+q) \tilde{w}(d) e(f(d)-f(d+q))
$$

For characters modulo a large prime, the shifted product provides Weil-type complete-sum cancellation. However, our modulus is precisely 4, and $\chi_4(n)$ is uniquely supported on odd integers, taking only the values $+1$ and $-1$. Let us rigorously evaluate the shifted character weight $C_q(d) = \chi_4(d)\chi_4(d+q)$ for fixed shifts $q$:

1.  **Odd shifts ($q \equiv 1, 3 \pmod 2$):** If $d$ is odd, $d+q$ is even, making $\chi_4(d+q) = 0$. The product vanishes entirely.
2.  **Even shifts congruent to 0 ($q \equiv 0 \pmod 4$):** Here, $d+q \equiv d \pmod 4$. For any odd $d$, $\chi_4(d+q) = \chi_4(d)$. Therefore, $C_q(d) = \chi_4(d)^2 = 1$.
3.  **Even shifts congruent to 2 ($q \equiv 2 \pmod 4$):** Here, $d+q \equiv d+2 \pmod 4$. Since adding 2 flips the parity of an odd integer modulo 4, $\chi_4(d+2) = -\chi_4(d)$. Therefore, $C_q(d) = -\chi_4(d)^2 = -1$.

In every surviving sublattice where the product is non-zero, the weight $C_q(d)$ evaluates exactly to $(-1)^{q/2}$. It is completely independent of the spatial variable $d$. The differencing step trivially eliminates the arithmetic sign oscillation of the character, reducing the character-aware sum to a standard character-blind geometric sum restricted to odd integers.

## 5. Precise hypotheses and parameter ranges

The diagnostic frameworks rely strictly on the parameter environment dictated by the Round 2 Judge:
*   **Scale parameters:** $X = R^2 \ge 1$. The error target is $O_\epsilon(X^{1/4+\epsilon})$.
*   **Hyperbola symmetry cut:** Spatial variables are naturally bounded by $y = \lfloor X^{1/2} \rfloor$.
*   **Dyadic blocks:** Smooth dyadic blocks characterized by lengths $D$ and $H_0$. The critical bottleneck is evaluated at the limits $D \asymp X^{1/2}$ and $H_0 \asymp X^{1/4}$.
*   **Phase structure:** The geometric phase behaves locally as $f(d) \approx hX/d$.
*   **H6 Hypothesis of 1D Blindness:** Assumes the analytic bound strictly factors through the absolute value $\sum_h |u_h| |S_h|$ and bounds $S_h$ via 1D Exponent Pair theory, ignoring possible cross-cancellation over $h$.
*   **H7 A-Process Hypothesis:** Assumes the A-process is applied directly to the spatial variable $d$ prior to any dualization or summation over $h$.

## 6. What is proved, what is heuristic, and what remains open

*   **Proved:** The algebraic reduction of the trivial $h$-summation exponent pair bound to the exact condition $p+2q \le 1$ at the $D \asymp X^{1/2}, H_0 \asymp X^{1/4}$ endpoint.
*   **Proved:** The exact structural collapse of the shifted character product $C_q(d)$ into the constants $\{0, 1, -1\}$ based entirely on $q \pmod 4$.
*   **Heuristic:** The assumption that the endpoint block $D \asymp X^{1/2}, H_0 \asymp X^{1/4}$ strictly defines the global bound limit. While representative of divisor-type problems, an asymmetric parameter optimization might theoretically accept an $\epsilon$-loss here if heavily compensated elsewhere.
*   **Remains Open:** Whether true 2D spacing bounds (like Bombieri-Iwaniec double large sieves) natively avoid the $p+2q \le 1$ scaling, and whether applying twisted Poisson summation (the B-process) *before* differencing maps the $\chi_4$ character into a Gauss sum format that resists the H7 modulus degeneracy.

## 7. Counterexample and stress-test checks

**Computational Check 1: Evaluating Record 1D Bounds against H6**
To stress-test the restrictive nature of the H6 diagnostic, we evaluate it against the apex of modern 1D continuous decoupling theory: Bourgain's 2017 exponent pair $(p,q) = (13/84 + \epsilon, 55/84 + \epsilon)$.
$$
p + 2q = \frac{13}{84} + 2\left(\frac{55}{84}\right) = \frac{13}{84} + \frac{110}{84} = \frac{123}{84} \approx 1.464
$$
Since $1.464 \not\le 1$, even this advanced unconditionally proved 1D bound fails the diagnostic by a massive margin. This mathematically confirms that naive 1D approaches to the phase are structurally inadequate.

**Symbolic Check 2: Verification of the $\chi_4$ Modulus Degeneracy**
We verify the identity $C_q(d) = \chi_4(d)\chi_4(d+q)$ for odd integers $d \in \{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\}$ against a fixed shift $q=2$:
*   $d=1$: $\chi_4(1)\chi_4(3) = (1)(-1) = -1$
*   $d=3$: $\chi_4(3)\chi_4(5) = (-1)(1) = -1$
*   $d=5$: $\chi_4(5)\chi_4(7) = (1)(-1) = -1$
*   $d=7$: $\chi_4(7)\chi_4(9) = (-1)(1) = -1$
The symbolic output strictly evaluates to $-1$ across the domain. The arithmetic oscillation over $d$ is verified to be completely erased.

## 8. Comparison with gpt_pro_thinking Round 3

Operating in Stage A, I anticipate `gpt_pro_thinking` will focus on formulating the Bombieri-Iwaniec matrices to evaluate the H5 dyadic targets (as instructed by the Judge to map Li-Yang 2023).

The Bombieri-Iwaniec method structurally avoids the trivial $h$-summation hypothesis of H6 because it keeps the $h$ parameter inside the Cauchy-Schwarz application, yielding 2D rational spacing conditions ($h_1 d_2 \approx h_2 d_1$). Therefore, `gpt_pro_thinking`'s expected path correctly sidesteps the 1D Exponent Pair obstruction. However, because Bombieri-Iwaniec relies heavily on a dispersion step (squaring out a variable to create the spacing matrix), if `gpt_pro_thinking` squares out the spatial variable $d$ directly in an attempt to leverage the character, it will collide violently with my H7 Modulus Degeneracy. My analysis serves as a crucial safety net: the 2D spacing must either be applied to the frequency variable, or the character must be dualized first.

## 9. Dependencies on known theorems

*   **Graham-Kolesnik Method (1991):** Standard $A$ and $B$ step parameter scaling for deriving exponential sum amplitudes from derivatives $|f^{(k)}(d)| \asymp \lambda / D^{k-1}$.
*   **Properties of Dirichlet Characters:** The fundamental parity, odd-integer support, and strict 4-periodicity of $\chi_4$, utilized in the exact algebraic evaluation of the A-process shifts.
*   **Riemann Zeta Function Limits:** The equivalence of the Exponent Pair Conjecture $(p,q) \to (0,1/2)$ with the optimal Lindelof Hypothesis error term, establishing the $p+2q \le 1$ boundary.
*   **Vaaler's Theorem:** Determines the frequency height $H_0 \asymp X^{1/4}$ based on bounding the unweighted $O(X^{1/2}/H_0)$ residual.

## 10. Confidence calibration and failure modes

**Confidence Level:**
*   *High confidence* in the algebraic truth of the A-process modulus degeneracy (H7) and the $p+2q \le 1$ parameter scaling reduction (H6).
*   *Moderate confidence* that these heuristics universally bind all possible analytic permutations, as breakthroughs in analytic number theory frequently bypass established barriers via structural transformations.

**Explicit Failure Modes:**
1.  **Failure Mode for H6 (VMVT Avoidance):** If a method utilizes a multi-dimensional Vinogradov Mean Value Theorem (VMVT) to harvest deep, simultaneous oscillation across $h$ and $d$ without separating them via absolute values, the trivial $h$-summation hypothesis fails, altering the scaling calculus.
2.  **Failure Mode for H7 (Major Arc Misalignment):** The conclusion that the A-process destroys cancellation assumes that the geometric major arcs of the phase difference $f(d) - f(d+q)$ align uniformly across all $q$. If the major arcs naturally concentrate strictly on odd $q$ (where the character sum evaluates exactly to 0), the degeneracy might inadvertently provide perfect, coincidental cancellation of the worst frequency collisions.
3.  **Failure Mode for H7 (B-Process First Evasion):** The degeneracy strictly applies if Weyl differencing occurs *first*. If a method applies the B-process (Poisson summation) to the $d$ sum first, it translates $\chi_4(d)$ into a Gauss sum $\tau(\chi_4)$ in the dual space. Applying differencing to the new dual variable might completely avoid the modulus-4 degeneracy.

### Explicit Lemmas and Claims for the Bank

> **Lemma H6: Diagnostic 1D Exponent-Pair Obstruction**
> *Status: Proved heuristic diagnostic (under stated hypotheses).*
> Assume the target $B_1(H_0,D;X)$ is estimated by taking absolute values over the frequency sum and applying a classical 1D Exponent Pair $(p,q)$ to the spatial sum. To achieve the bound $O(X^{1/4+\epsilon})$ at the critical Vaaler endpoint $D \asymp X^{1/2}, H_0 \asymp X^{1/4}$, the exponent pair must satisfy $p+2q \le 1$. Under the stated character-blind reduction and trivial summation over $h$, the required bound appears to force this exponent-pair-type condition, indicating that iterated 1D approaches are structurally stalled.

> **Lemma H7: A-Process Modulus Degeneracy for $\chi_4$**
> *Status: Proved algebraic obstruction.*
> For the spatial-character sum $\sum_d \chi_4(d) e(f(d))$, Weyl differencing (the A-process) produces the shifted weight $C_q(d) = \chi_4(d)\chi_4(d+q)$. Because the modulus is 4, for any fixed shift $q$, $C_q(d)$ is identically constant on the odd integers (evaluating to $1$ for $q \equiv 0 \pmod 4$, $-1$ for $q \equiv 2 \pmod 4$, and $0$ for odd $q$). The differencing step thus eradicates the character's arithmetic oscillation, preventing standard Weil-type complete-sum cancellation.

> **Claim C1: Bourgain 2017 Obstruction Stress Test**
> *Status: Verified computational check.*
> Evaluating Bourgain's optimal 1D decoupling pair $(13/84+\epsilon, 55/84+\epsilon)$ against the H6 diagnostic yields $p+2q = 123/84 \approx 1.464$. Since $1.464 \not\le 1$, even the sharpest modern 1D bounds fail the character-blind threshold, confirming the necessity of true 2D or character-aware methods.

> **Claim C2: B-Process Character Dualization Route**
> *Status: Proposed analytical workaround.*
> To bypass the H7 modulus degeneracy while retaining character sensitivity, analytical methods should apply Twisted Poisson Summation (the B-process) to the spatial variable prior to any Cauchy-Schwarz dispersion. This preserves the character's orthogonality by converting it into an additive Gauss sum multiplier in the dual frequency domain.
