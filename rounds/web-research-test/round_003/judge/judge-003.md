# Selected main route

Continue the **balanced arithmetic hyperbola/sawtooth route** as the main analytic route. Retain the smoothed Poisson--Bessel route only as a calibration route for smoothing, unsmoothing, and recovery of the classical $R^{2/3}$-scale sanity check.

The active Round 3 prompt asks for a Stage C judge synthesis and restricts this run to two active agents, `gpt_pro_thinking` and `gemini_deep_think`; older references to inactive agents should be ignored as historical state noise.

The current proof skeleton is:

$$
P(X)=N(\sqrt X)-\pi X
\longrightarrow
\text{symmetric hyperbola}
\longrightarrow
\text{floor-compatible sawtooth}
\longrightarrow
\text{finite Vaaler}
\longrightarrow
\text{local dyadic reciprocal sums}.
$$

The target remains:

$$
P(X)\ll_\epsilon X^{1/4+\epsilon},
$$

equivalently

$$
E(R)\ll_\epsilon R^{1/2+\epsilon}.
$$

Round 3 makes one real promotion and one strategic correction:

1. **Promote H7 to proved.** The shifted product $\chi_4(d)\chi_4(d+q)$ degenerates to a parity-supported constant after a direct A-process. This is an explicit algebraic obstruction.

2. **Downgrade H6.** The one-dimensional exponent-pair obstruction is useful, but only as a conditional diagnostic. The inequality $p+2q\le 1$ should not be entered as final until the exponent-pair normalization is fixed. Under the standard reciprocal-phase scaling $T\asymp hX/D$, the endpoint calculation instead gives the condition $3p+2q\le 1$.

No improvement to the Gauss circle exponent has been proved. The concrete Round 3 gain is a sharper obstruction map around the character $\chi_4$ and a better local dyadic target.

# Useful fragments by source

## From `gpt_pro_thinking`

The main useful contribution is the completed balanced reduction. The current state now supports treating H1, H2, and H3 as proved floor-compatible identities, with numerical checks still useful as guardrails.

Let

$$
\chi=\chi_4,\qquad
T(X)=\sum_{ab\le X}\chi(a),\qquad
S(u)=\sum_{1\le a\le u}\chi(a),\qquad
y=\lfloor X^{1/2}\rfloor.
$$

Then

$$
N(\sqrt X)=1+4T(X),
$$

and

$$
T(X)
=
\sum_{a\le y}\chi(a)\left\lfloor\frac Xa\right\rfloor
+
\sum_{b\le y}S(X/b)
-
yS(y).
$$

Also,

$$
S(u)
=
\left\lfloor\frac{u+3}{4}\right\rfloor
- \left\lfloor\frac{u+1}{4}\right\rfloor
=
\frac12+
\psi\left(\frac{u+1}{4}\right)
-
\psi\left(\frac{u+3}{4}\right),
$$

where

$$
\psi(t)=t-\lfloor t\rfloor-\frac12.
$$

Thus the oscillatory part is

$$
W(X)
=
-4\sum_{a\le y}\chi(a)\psi(X/a)
+
4\sum_{b\le y}
\left[
\psi\left(\frac{X/b+1}{4}\right)
-
\psi\left(\frac{X/b+3}{4}\right)
\right].
$$

The exact residual is

$$
P(X)-W(X)
=
1+
4X\left(\sum_{a\le y}\frac{\chi(a)}a-\frac{\pi}{4}\right)
+
2y-2S(y)-4yS(y).
$$

The four-case Gregory-tail estimate

$$
L(1,\chi_4)-\sum_{a\le y}\frac{\chi(a)}a
=
\frac{1-2S(y)}{2y}
+
O(y^{-2})
$$

then gives

$$
P(X)-W(X)=O(1).
$$

This is the current best exact arithmetic foundation.

The second useful contribution is the **local Vaaler cutoff**. For a dyadic denominator block $d\sim D$, the zeroth-order Vaaler residual is $D/H_D$. To keep it at the conjectural scale $X^{1/4}$, choose

$$
H_D\asymp D X^{-1/4}
$$

for

$$
X^{1/4}\le D\le X^{1/2}.
$$

Blocks with $D<X^{1/4}$ are already short enough for separate treatment. This local range is now preferred over a global $H\le X^{1/4}$ range. The Round 3 review explicitly recommends replacing the global H5 range by this local cutoff and adding H5r for Fejer residuals.

## From `gemini_deep_think`

Gemini's strongest Round 3 contribution is **H7: A-process modulus degeneracy for $\chi_4$**. After Weyl differencing,

$$
\chi_4(d)\chi_4(d+q)
=
\begin{cases}
1_{2\nmid d},& q\equiv 0\pmod 4,\
-1_{2\nmid d},& q\equiv 2\pmod 4,\
0,& q\equiv 1,3\pmod 4.
\end{cases}
$$

This is algebraically correct. It means a direct A-process destroys the nontrivial mod-$4$ oscillation and leaves only a parity restriction. Gemini's own output states that this collapse is conditional on applying the A-process directly to the spatial variable before dualization or summation over $h$.

Gemini's second useful contribution is the softened H6 diagnostic: if a method first takes absolute values over $h$, then applies only a one-dimensional exponent-pair bound to the inner $d$-sum, it is unlikely to reach the conjectural endpoint. The useful part is the hypothesis list: absolute values over $h$, one-dimensional treatment of $d$, and no two-variable cross-cancellation. The overclaim is the specific inequality and any universal conclusion.

Gemini's third useful contribution is the **B-process-first escape route**. Since H7 only blocks A-process-first methods, one possible next route is to apply twisted Poisson/B-process to the $\chi_4(d)$-twisted spatial sum before differencing, and then check whether $\chi_4$ becomes a Gauss-sum factor in the dual variable. This is proposed, not proved.

## Literature calibration

Li--Yang's paper states that it improves both the Gauss circle and Dirichlet divisor problems using the Bombieri--Iwaniec method, with a new first-spacing estimate combined with Huxley's second-spacing results. It proves $R(X),\Delta(X)=O_\epsilon(X^{\theta^*+\epsilon})$ with $\theta^*=0.3144831759741\ldots$, while the conjectural target is $\theta=1/4$.

ANTEDB records Li--Yang 2023 as the current sharpest listed two-dimensional Gauss-circle upper bound, $\theta_2^{\operatorname{Gauss}}\le 2\alpha$ with $\alpha=0.31448\ldots$, and lists Huxley 2003 at $131/208$ in $R$-notation. ([Teorth][1])

# Rejected or risky ideas

1. **Reject H6 as a proved theorem.**
   H6 should not say "character-blind methods require $p+2q\le 1$" as a final theorem. That condition depends on the exponent-pair convention. Under the standard convention for $f(d)=hX/d$ with derivative scale $T\asymp hX/D$, an exponent pair $(p,q)$ gives

$$
   \sum_{d\sim D}e(hX/d)\ll (hX/D)^pD^q.
$$

At the endpoint $D\asymp X^{1/2}$ and $h\asymp X^{1/4}$ this is

$$
   X^{3p/4+q/2}.
$$

Since the raw dyadic target permits only $X^{1/4+\epsilon}$ for the inner sum after trivial $h$-summation, the condition becomes

$$
   3p+2q\le 1.
$$

This still forces endpoint-level strength, but the lemma bank must use a named theorem and a fixed normalization.

2. **Reject H7 as a universal impossibility theorem.**
   H7 proves only that **A-process first** destroys the $\chi_4$ oscillation. It does not rule out B-process-first, residue interference, two-dimensional spacing, double large sieve, VMVT-type estimates, or completion methods.

3. **Reject "B-process first is mandatory" as a theorem.**
   B-process first is now a serious proposed route, but no transformed sum has yet been written with exact ranges, Gauss factors, or stationary phase. It belongs in the gap register as H8, not in the proved lemma bank.

4. **Reject scalar Vaaler residuals.**
   The finite Vaaler residual is not merely $O(D/H_D)$. The Fejer majorant contributes nonzero-frequency reciprocal sums. Any proof skeleton that omits H5r is incomplete.

5. **Reject "residue splitting proves no advantage" as a theorem.**
   Splitting $\chi_4(d)$ into $d\equiv 1,3\pmod 4$ often converts H5a into a finite combination of Li--Yang-type reciprocal sums. This suggests limited character advantage, but it does not prove impossibility. Interference between residue-class sums may still matter.

6. **Reject Deligne/Weil claims from shifted $\chi_4$ products.**
   Since H7 shows the shifted product is just $0,\pm 1$ on parity sublattices, there is no deep complete character sum at that stage. Any Weil/Deligne claim must first exhibit a genuine complete sum with a nontrivial modulus.

# Known gaps

1. **Finite Vaaler theorem with floor-compatible discontinuities.**
   H3 is an exact identity for the floor-compatible sawtooth. The finite Fourier/Vaaler approximation uses centered trigonometric conventions. The next proof draft must state precisely how discontinuity points are handled.

2. **Exact H5r residual formulation.**
   The Fejer residual terms must be written explicitly, not schematically. The main open question is whether the residual can be dominated by the same H5a/H5b estimates, or whether it forces absolute values that activate the H6 diagnostic.

3. **B-process-first transformation.**
   H8 needs a concrete formula. The next step is to transform

$$
   \sum_{d\sim D}\chi_4(d)w(d/D)e(hX/d)
$$

by a twisted Poisson/B-process step, identify the dual phase, identify any Gauss-sum factor, and record the resulting dual length and derivative scales.

4. **Li--Yang dictionary.**
   The repository needs a precise dictionary from the local H5 ranges

$$
   X^{1/4}\le D\le X^{1/2},
   \qquad
   H_0\le D X^{-1/4}
$$

to Li--Yang's double sums of the form

$$
   \sum_{h\sim H}\sum_{m\sim M} e(-hT/m)
$$

and their more general $F(m/M)$ setup. Li--Yang explicitly identify such reciprocal double sums as typical for the circle and divisor problems.

5. **Known-technology gap.**
   Li--Yang reaches $\theta^*=0.314483\ldots$, not $\theta=1/4$. The current H5 target is therefore stronger than what has been established by existing Li--Yang technology. Any claim that H5 is "available" must specify a new first-spacing, second-spacing, or orthogonality improvement.

6. **Bessel calibration still absent.**
   The Poisson--Bessel route remains secondary, but the repo should still contain a clean proof of the smoothed formula, sandwich/unsmoothing lemma, and $R^{2/3}$ sanity check.

7. **Numerical stress tests still missing.**
   H3 has an explicit proof, but boundary tests should still be run to prevent transcription or convention errors.

# New lemmas to add

## H1. Exact symmetric hyperbola identity

**Status: proved.**

For $X\ge 1$, $y=\lfloor X^{1/2}\rfloor$, and

$$
S(u)=\sum_{1\le a\le u}\chi_4(a),
$$

one has

$$
\sum_{ab\le X}\chi_4(a)
=
\sum_{a\le y}\chi_4(a)\left\lfloor\frac Xa\right\rfloor
+
\sum_{b\le y}S(X/b)
-
yS(y).
$$

Proof: every pair $(a,b)$ with $ab\le X$ has $a\le y$ or $b\le y$, since $a,b>y$ implies $ab>(y+1)^2>X$. The overlap is the rectangle $a\le y$, $b\le y$.

## H2. Exact periodic formula for $S(u)$

**Status: proved.**

For real $u\ge 0$,

$$
S(u)
=
\left\lfloor\frac{u+3}{4}\right\rfloor
- \left\lfloor\frac{u+1}{4}\right\rfloor.
$$

Equivalently,

$$
S(u)
=
\frac12+
\psi\left(\frac{u+1}{4}\right)
-
\psi\left(\frac{u+3}{4}\right),
$$

with

$$
\psi(t)=t-\lfloor t\rfloor-\frac12.
$$

## H3. Balanced sawtooth formula

**Status: proved as an $O(1)$ floor-compatible identity.**

For $X\ge 1$,

$$
P(X)
=
-4\sum_{a\le y}\chi_4(a)\psi(X/a)
+
4\sum_{b\le y}
\left[
\psi\left(\frac{X/b+1}{4}\right)
-
\psi\left(\frac{X/b+3}{4}\right)
\right]
+
O(1),
$$

where $y=\lfloor X^{1/2}\rfloor$.

The proof goes through the exact residual

$$
P(X)-W(X)
=
1+
4X\left(\sum_{a\le y}\frac{\chi_4(a)}a-\frac{\pi}{4}\right)
+
2y-2S(y)-4yS(y),
$$

and the four-case tail estimate

$$
L(1,\chi_4)-\sum_{a\le y}\frac{\chi_4(a)}a
=
\frac{1-2S(y)}{2y}+O(y^{-2}).
$$

## H4. Finite Vaaler with dual-character bookkeeping

**Status: proposed technical lemma.**

For each dyadic block $d\sim D$, choose

$$
H_D\asymp D X^{-1/4}
$$

when $D\ge X^{1/4}$.

For a finite Vaaler main polynomial

$$
\psi(t)=\sum_{1\le |h|\le H_D}\alpha_h e(ht)+\mathcal R_{H_D}(t),
\qquad
\alpha_h\ll |h|^{-1},
$$

the first leg contributes main terms

$$
\sum_{1\le |h|\le H_D}\alpha_h
\sum_{a\sim D}\chi_4(a)w(a/D)e(hX/a).
$$

The second leg contributes main terms

$$
\sum_{1\le |h|\le H_D}
\alpha_h
\left(e(h/4)-e(3h/4)\right)
\sum_{b\sim D}w(b/D)e(hX/(4b)).
$$

Since

$$
e(h/4)-e(3h/4)=2i\chi_4(h),
$$

the second main family is frequency-character-twisted. The residual $\mathcal R_{H_D}$ must be handled separately.

## H5a. Spatial-character local dyadic target

**Status: sufficient target, not known.**

For

$$
X^{1/4}\le D\le X^{1/2},
\qquad
1\le H_0\le D X^{-1/4},
$$

define

$$
B_1(H_0,D;X)
=
\sum_{h\sim H_0}u_h
\sum_{d\sim D}\chi_4(d)w(d/D)e(hX/d),
\qquad |u_h|\le 1.
$$

A sufficient target is

$$
B_1(H_0,D;X)
\ll_\epsilon
H_0X^{1/4+\epsilon}.
$$

## H5b. Frequency-character local dyadic target

**Status: sufficient target, not known.**

For the same range,

$$
B_2(H_0,D;X)
=
\sum_{h\sim H_0}u_h\chi_4(h)
\sum_{d\sim D}w(d/D)e(hX/(4d)).
$$

A sufficient target is

$$
B_2(H_0,D;X)
\ll_\epsilon
H_0X^{1/4+\epsilon}.
$$

Equivalently, using

$$
\chi_4(h)=\frac{e(h/4)-e(3h/4)}{2i},
$$

this is a finite combination of phase-shifted reciprocal sums.

## H5r. Fejer-residual local dyadic target

**Status: required but not yet exact.**

The next round must derive the exact residual target from the chosen Vaaler theorem. The expected schematic form is:

$$
\frac{1}{H_D}
\sum_{H_0\le H_D}
\left|
\sum_{h\sim H_0}v_h
\sum_{d\sim D}c_d e(\lambda hX/d+\mu h)
\right|
\ll_\epsilon X^{1/4+\epsilon},
$$

with $c_d$ representing the spatial-character, residue-class, or untwisted coefficient classes arising from the two legs. This is only schematic until the exact Vaaler majorant is fixed.

## H6. Conditional one-dimensional exponent-pair diagnostic

**Status: diagnostic, not proved theorem.**

Assume a method bounds $B_1$ by taking absolute values over $h$ and applying a one-dimensional exponent-pair theorem to the inner $d$-sum. Under the standard reciprocal scaling $T\asymp hX/D$, the endpoint block

$$
D\asymp X^{1/2},
\qquad
H_0\asymp X^{1/4}
$$

requires

$$
3p+2q\le 1
$$

to reach the conjectural dyadic target.

If another exponent-pair convention is used, the inequality must be recomputed from the stated theorem. Do not record $p+2q\le 1$ as final without a named convention.

## H7. A-process modulus degeneracy for $\chi_4$

**Status: proved algebraic lemma.**

For every integer $q$,

$$
\chi_4(d)\chi_4(d+q)
=
\begin{cases}
1_{2\nmid d},& q\equiv 0\pmod 4,\
-1_{2\nmid d},& q\equiv 2\pmod 4,\
0,& q\equiv 1,3\pmod 4.
\end{cases}
$$

Corollary: Weyl differencing applied directly to the spatial-character sum removes the nontrivial mod-$4$ oscillation. This blocks naive claims of Weil/Deligne savings from shifted $\chi_4$ products. The Round 3 review independently identifies this as the key algebraic obstruction.

## H8. B-process-first character-dualization route

**Status: proposed.**

Before applying A-process or Cauchy--Schwarz, apply twisted Poisson/B-process to

$$
\sum_{d\sim D}\chi_4(d)w(d/D)e(hX/d).
$$

Required output:

1. exact transformed sum;
2. dual length;
3. dual phase;
4. Gauss-sum factor, if present;
5. comparison with H7;
6. comparison with Li--Yang/Bombieri--Iwaniec spacing hypotheses.

# Counterexample checks to run

1. **H3 boundary check.**
   Evaluate both sides of H3 for:

* $0<X<1$;
   * $X=1,2,3,4,5$;
   * integer squares;
   * integer nonsquares;
   * $X=n^2\pm 10^{-k}$;
   * $X$ just below and just above an integer.

2. **Sawtooth convention check.**
   Compare the floor-compatible value $\psi(n)=-1/2$ with the Fourier midpoint convention at discontinuities. Record exactly where Vaaler changes the value.

3. **Finite Vaaler residual check.**
   For several dyadic $D$, compute the zeroth-order residual $D/H_D$ and representative Fejer nonzero-frequency residual sums. Confirm whether H5r dominates them.

4. **H6 scaling check.**
   Recompute the endpoint condition under two conventions:

* $T\asymp hX/D$;
   * $\lambda\asymp hX/D^2$.

The lemma bank should contain only the version attached to a named exponent-pair theorem.

5. **H7 symbolic check.**
   Verify $\chi_4(d)\chi_4(d+q)$ for $q\bmod 4$ and $d\bmod 4$. This is simple but should be included as a permanent guardrail.

6. **B-process toy check.**
   Apply completion or Poisson summation to a compactly supported model sum

$$
   \sum_{d}\chi_4(d)w(d/D)e(hX/d)
$$

in a range where stationary phase is valid. Determine whether the dual sum genuinely avoids H7 or merely repackages the same parity restriction.

7. **Residue-class interference test.**
   Split

$$
   \sum_{d\sim D}\chi_4(d)e(hX/d)
$$

into $d=4m+1$ and $d=4m+3$. Determine whether any cancellation between the two residue classes survives standard absolute values or spacing reductions.

# Next round instructions

## For `gpt_pro_thinking`

Update the best proof draft and reading packet with the following status changes:

* H1, H2, H3: proved floor-compatible reductions.
* H4: proposed finite Vaaler lemma with dual-character bookkeeping.
* H5a/H5b: local dyadic targets with $H_0\le D X^{-1/4}$.
* H5r: required Fejer-residual target, not yet exact.
* H6: conditional one-dimensional diagnostic; recompute the exponent-pair inequality under a named convention.
* H7: proved algebraic obstruction.
* H8: proposed B-process-first route.

Then write the exact Vaaler lemma needed for H4/H5r, including the residual majorant and the discontinuity convention.

## For `gemini_deep_think`

Focus on H8. Write the B-process-first transformation for the spatial-character sum

$$
\sum_{d\sim D}\chi_4(d)w(d/D)e(hX/d).
$$

The output must state the transformed sum, dual length, dual phase, and whether $\chi_4$ becomes a Gauss-sum factor or only a residue-class selector. It should explicitly check whether the transformed problem avoids H7 or simply delays the same parity degeneration.

Also redo H6 with one named exponent-pair theorem and one fixed normalization. The output should say whether the correct endpoint inequality is $p+2q\le 1$, $3p+2q\le 1$, or something else under that theorem.

# Confidence

High confidence in the selected main route: balanced hyperbola, floor-compatible sawtooth, finite Vaaler, and local dyadic reciprocal sums.

High confidence in H1, H2, H3, and H7.

Moderate confidence in the local cutoff $H_D\asymp D X^{-1/4}$ as the right conjectural-scale dyadic calibration.

Moderate confidence that H5a/H5b can be matched structurally to Li--Yang-type reciprocal sums after residue and phase-shift bookkeeping.

Low confidence that current Bombieri--Iwaniec/Li--Yang technology reaches the $X^{1/4+\epsilon}$ target without a new input. Li--Yang's published target exponent is $\theta^*=0.314483\ldots$, while the conjectural endpoint is $\theta=1/4$.

Low confidence that $\chi_4$ alone gives a usable saving after a standard A-process, because H7 shows that direct differencing collapses the character to parity.
