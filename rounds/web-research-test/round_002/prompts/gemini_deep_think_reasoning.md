You are Gemini Deep Think, acting as independent alternative strategist and obstacle finder.

We are running a public GitHub based multi-AI mathematics research workflow.

Follow the protocol and be strict about separating proved claims from conjectural ideas.

## Agent-Specific Instructions

Use Gemini Pro Deep Think. Deliberately think longer and answer in substantially more detail than a normal response. Do not optimize for brevity. Match the depth expected from a mathematical referee report: give precise statements, parameter ranges, dependencies, and explicit gap audits. Avoid overconfident language. Do not say 'prove', 'formally prove', 'strictly requires', 'must abandon', or similar unless the proof is actually supplied in the response. Prefer calibrated phrases such as 'suggests', 'would require showing', 'appears to reduce to', 'under the following hypotheses', and 'confidence: low/moderate/high with reasons'. For every strong claim, include at least one missing hypothesis or possible failure mode. Include a dedicated section called 'Confidence calibration and failure modes'.

## Protocol

# Multi-AI Mathematical Research Protocol

## Agents

The default four-agent panel is:

Any agent can be replaced as long as it follows the same output schema.

## Round Structure

Rounds use a strict barrier synchronization rule:

- Stage B cannot begin until every agent has completed Stage A.
- Stage C cannot begin until every agent has completed Stage B.
- Stage D cannot begin until the judge synthesis is complete.
- The next round cannot begin until Stage D has been committed and pushed.

### Stage A: Independent Reasoning

Each agent receives:

- the problem statement,
- the current reading packet,
- the current lemma bank,
- the current gap register,
- the prior judge decision if available,
- the agent-specific task.

The agent must output:

```text
Summary:
Main claim or direction:
Detailed reasoning:
Dependencies:
Potential gaps:
Counterexample or obstruction search:
Useful lemmas:
What should be tested next:
Confidence:
```

### Stage B: Cross Review

Each agent reviews all other agents' Stage A outputs.

The review must output:

```text
Most valuable input from others:
Claims that look correct:
Claims that need proof:
Possible errors or hidden assumptions:
Suggested synthesis:
Score by agent:
Next-round recommendation:
```

### Stage C: Judge Synthesis

The judge reads all Stage A outputs and Stage B reviews.

The judge must output:

```text
Selected main route:
Useful fragments by source:
Rejected or risky ideas:
Known gaps:
New lemmas to add:
Counterexample checks to run:
Next round instructions:
Confidence:
```

### Stage D: State Update

The orchestrator updates:

- `state/current_state.md`: compact current research state.
- `state/lemma_bank.md`: proposed, proved, and rejected lemmas.
- `state/gap_register.md`: known gaps and possible failure points.
- `state/best_proof_draft.md`: best current proof skeleton.
- `manifests/reading_packet.md`: the compact packet for the next round.

## Public Repo Rule

The public GitHub repo is the permanent log. Every completed round should be committed and pushed.

Agents should normally read `manifests/reading_packet.md`, not the full repo. Full round files remain available for audit and later reconstruction.

## Human Intervention Rule

Human intervention is allowed at any time between stages or rounds.

Human input can appear in:

- `human/current_directives.md`
- `human/goals.md`
- `human/ideas.md`
- `human/references.md`
- `human/inbox/*.md`
- GitHub issues or comments that are manually copied into the files above

Human instructions override previous AI suggestions when they change the target, introduce a reference, reject a route, add a constraint, or change the success criterion.

Agents must explicitly acknowledge relevant human interventions in their next output.

## Mathematical Safety Rules

- Do not mark a claim as proved unless the proof is explicit.
- Preserve failed attempts; they help avoid repeated false starts.
- When a proof step uses an external theorem, name the theorem and state the needed hypotheses.
- Require counterexample search for any new lemma.
- Prefer small checkable lemmas over broad vague routes.
- Keep notation stable across rounds.

## Markdown Output Rule

Return clean Markdown source. For mathematics, use only:

- inline math: `$...$`
- display math:

```text
$$
...
$$
```

Do not use rendered-equation copy formats. Do not use bare bracket math like `[ ... ]`.
Avoid `\[ ... \]` and `\( ... \)` because some web copy tools drop the backslashes.

## Research-Mode Quality Rubric

This is a research-mode run, not a smoke test. Take enough time to reason carefully before answering. Prefer correctness, explicit assumptions, rigorous gap detection, and precise lemma statements over speed or brevity.

Before writing the final response, internally check your proposal against known barriers, missing hypotheses, possible counterexamples, and literature-status uncertainty. In the final answer, report the refined result rather than hidden chain-of-thought.

For reasoning stages, include: main route, precise lemmas, theorem dependencies, hidden assumptions, obstruction or counterexample checks, what would falsify the route, and confidence.

For review stages, include: valuable ideas from other agents, claims that look correct, claims needing proof, likely false or underspecified claims, missing hypotheses, and concrete synthesis recommendations.

For judge stages, include: selected route, useful fragments by source, rejected or risky ideas, exact gaps, new lemma statements, next-round tasks, and confidence.

## Problem

# Gauss Circle Problem

## Problem

Let

```text
N(R) = #{(m,n) in Z^2 : m^2 + n^2 <= R^2}.
```

The classical Gauss circle problem asks for the best possible exponent in the error term

```text
N(R) = pi R^2 + E(R).
```

The conjectural bound is

```text
E(R) = O_epsilon(R^{1/2 + epsilon})
```

for every epsilon > 0.

## Research Goal For This Repo

Use a multi-AI collaborative workflow to explore strategies, partial lemmas, obstacles, and proof sketches related to improving or understanding the Gauss circle problem error term.

The immediate goal is not to claim a solution, but to build a rigorous research log:

- identify plausible approaches,
- isolate precise lemmas,
- track gaps,
- test claims against known barriers,
- maintain a best current proof skeleton.

## Initial Directions To Consider

- Poisson summation and Bessel function expansions.
- Exponential sum bounds and exponent pairs.
- Smoothing and unsmoothing arguments.
- Lattice point discrepancy methods.
- Connections to the divisor problem.
- Lower-bound obstructions and omega results.
- Computational checks for small or structured ranges.

## Current State Bundle

No completed rounds yet.

The first round should focus on strategy selection, known barriers, and a clean decomposition of the Gauss circle error term.

## Round 1 Update

Timestamp: 2026-05-31 22:51:21

See `rounds/web-research-test/round_001/judge/judge.md`.

Selected main route:

Adopt a **two-track decomposition, with the arithmetic hyperbola/sawtooth route as the main analytic route and the smoothed Poisson--Bessel route as a normalization and sanity-check route**.

The main Round 2 objective should not be "prove the conjecture." It should be to produce a verified, endpoint-safe reduction from

$$
E(R)=N(R)-\pi R^2
$$

to balanced dyadic sums coming from the identity

$$
r_2(n)=4\sum_{d\mid n}\chi_4(d),
$$

with $X=R^2$ and target

$$
P(X):=N(\sqrt X)-\pi X=O_\epsilon(X^{1/4+\epsilon}).
$$

The selected analytic route is:

1. Prove an exact **symmetric Dirichlet hyperbola identity** for

$$
T(X):=\sum_{ab\le X}\chi_4(a),
\qquad
N(\sqrt X)=1+4T(X).
$$

2. Convert this identity into sawtooth terms using

$$
\psi(t)=t-\lfloor t\rfloor-\frac12
$$

with explicit endpoint conventions.

3. Apply Vaaler truncation only after the hyperbola cut, so the sums have length about $\sqrt X$ rather than $X$.

4. Derive the exact dyadic exponential-sum target, expected to involve sums of the schematic form

$$
\sum_{h\sim H}\frac{1}{h}
\sum_{d\sim D} c_d e\left(\frac{hX}{d}\right),
\qquad D\le X^{1/2},
$$

with $c_d$ equal either to $\chi_4(d)$ or to coefficients arising from the second hyperbola leg.

Useful fragments by source:

**From `gpt_pro_thinking`:**

The strongest contribution is the normalization into two complementary forms: a smoothed Poisson--Bessel decomposition and an arithmetic sawtooth decomposition using $r_2(n)=4\sum_{d\mid n}\chi_4(d)$. This is the right first-round foundation. The Poisson--Bessel side should remain in the repo because it gives a checkable smoothing/unsmoothing framework and recovers the classical $R^{2/3}$ estimate from trivial radial-sum bounds.

The proposed conditional benchmark

$$
A_M(R)
=
\sum_{k\ne 0}w(|k|/M)e(R|k|)
\ll_\epsilon M^{3/2}R^\epsilon
$$

is useful as a diagnostic criterion, not as a likely direct proof route. It quantifies what type of cancellation the smoothed geometric formulation would need.

The arithmetic identity

$$
P(X)
=
-4\sum_{d\le X}\chi_4(d)\psi(X/d)+O(1)
$$

is valuable as a compact exact reduction, but it should not be the final analytic form for Vaaler truncation. Before estimation, the sum should be shortened by the Dirichlet hyperbola method.

The literature-status discipline is also valuable: record Huxley, Bourgain--Watt, Li--Yang, and ANTEDB separately, and do not use any record exponent as a black-box dependency until the theorem statement and hypotheses are checked.

**From `gemini_deep_think`:**

The most useful mathematical warning is that the raw geometric phase

$$
R\sqrt{x^2+y^2}
$$

and the homogeneous model phase

$$
R\sqrt{ab}
$$

have rank-deficient Hessian. Therefore any proposed proof that applies a generic full-rank two-dimensional stationary phase or decoupling theorem directly to these phases is invalid.

The proposed symmetric hyperbola route is also useful. The exact formula as stated by Gemini should not be marked proved, but the idea of replacing the length-$X$ sawtooth sum with a balanced hyperbola decomposition is correct and should become the main Round 2 task. Gemini's review also correctly flags the analytic cost of applying Vaaler directly to the unbalanced $d\le X$ identity.

Gemini's "character blindness" warning is worth preserving as a gap: after reduction to exponential sums, one must know whether $\chi_4$ is actually being exploited or merely discarded by absolute values. However, this warning needs to be converted into precise coefficient classes and estimates.

**From `gpt_pro_thinking` Stage B review:**

The review correctly demotes Gemini's exact hyperbola formula from "proved" to "proposed." It also gives the right next-step decomposition: split the hyperbola assertion into smaller lemmas H1--H4, separating exact counting, periodic partial sums, main-term cancellation, and Vaaler truncation.

Rejected or risky ideas:

1. **Reject as proved: Gemini's exact hyperbola formula.**
   The formula

$$
E(R)
=
-4\sum_{a\le R}\chi_4(a)\psi(R^2/a)
+
4\sum_{b\le R}
\left[
\psi\left(\frac{R^2/b+1}{4}\right)
-
\psi\left(\frac{R^2/b+3}{4}\right)
\right]
+
O(1)
$$

is plausible in spirit, but it was not proved in Round 1. It must be derived from an exact hyperbola identity with $y=\lfloor \sqrt X\rfloor$, explicit endpoint conventions, and a verified bounded residual.

2. **Reject: "nonzero Hessian unlocks modern decoupling" as a theorem.**
   For the phase

$$
\Phi(h,d)=\frac{hX}{d},
$$

the formal Hessian determinant in continuous variables is nonzero. That calculation is correct, but it does not by itself imply that Bourgain--Watt, Bombieri--Iwaniec, or any decoupling theorem applies. The needed theorem, coefficient hypotheses, dyadic ranges, spacing conditions, and loss factors must be stated.

3. **Reject: abandoning Bessel methods entirely.**
   The Bessel route is risky as a direct source of new exponents because of radial degeneracy. It is still useful for smoothing, unsmoothing, checking notation, and recovering the classical $R^{2/3}$ sanity bound.

4. **Reject: "smoothing artificially erases point-mass spikes."**
   Smoothing without an unsmoothing argument is dangerous. Standard smoothing with a sandwich lemma is legitimate and should remain in the technical toolkit.

5. **Treat as risky: the radial benchmark $A_M(R)\ll M^{3/2}R^\epsilon$.**
   It is a clean sufficient condition, but not a near-term lemma. The Hessian warning suggests that generic two-dimensional nondegenerate tools are unavailable for this raw radial phase.

Known gaps:

1. **Endpoint conventions for $\psi$.**
   The identity

$$
\lfloor t\rfloor=t-\psi(t)-\frac12
$$

is exact if $\psi(t)=t-\lfloor t\rfloor-\frac12$, including $\psi(n)=-1/2$ at integers. Fourier series and Vaaler approximations usually behave differently at discontinuities. This must be recorded explicitly.

2. **Exact symmetric hyperbola identity.**
   The repo needs a proved identity for

$$
T(X)=\sum_{ab\le X}\chi_4(a)
$$

with $y=\lfloor\sqrt X\rfloor$:

$$
T(X)
=
\sum_{a\le y}\chi_4(a)\left\lfloor\frac Xa\right\rfloor
+
\sum_{b\le y}S(X/b)
-
yS(y),
$$

where

$$
S(u)=\sum_{a\le u}\chi_4(a).
$$

3. **Periodic partial-sum formula.**
   One needs a fully checked formula for $S(u)$, for real $u$, including integer endpoints. A likely exact formula is

$$
S(u)
=
\left\lfloor\frac{u+3}{4}\right\rfloor
- \left\lfloor\frac{u+1}{4}\right\rfloor
=
\frac12+
\psi\left(\frac{u+1}{4}\right)
-
\psi\left(\frac{u+3}{4}\right),
$$

with the same floor-compatible convention for $\psi$.

4. **Main-term cancellation after the symmetric cut.**
   After substituting the floor and $S(u)$ formulas, the nonoscillatory terms must be shown to equal $\pi X/4+O(1)$ at the level of $T(X)$. This is the critical algebraic step behind Gemini's proposed formula.

5. **Vaaler truncation error.**
   The truncation error must be derived with full dependence on the length $D$, Fourier height $H$, and endpoint/jump terms. The heuristic "error is length divided by $H$" is not enough.

6. **Dyadic parameter map.**
   The route needs a precise map from the hyperbola formula to dyadic ranges $D,H,T$, with $T=X$, $D\le X^{1/2}$, and $H$ chosen according to the actual Vaaler error. This must precede any appeal to Bombieri--Iwaniec-type estimates.

7. **Coefficient handling.**
   The role of $\chi_4(d)$ must be explicit. The repo should distinguish estimates that exploit the character from estimates that merely bound $|c_d|\le 1$.

8. **Literature audit.**
   Record-exponent claims should be audited from primary sources before being treated as dependencies.

New lemmas to add:

**Lemma H1: Exact symmetric hyperbola identity.**
Status: proposed, expected standard.

For $X\ge 1$, set $y=\lfloor\sqrt X\rfloor$ and

$$
S(u)=\sum_{1\le a\le u}\chi_4(a).
$$

Then

$$
\sum_{ab\le X}\chi_4(a)
=
\sum_{a\le y}\chi_4(a)\left\lfloor\frac Xa\right\rfloor
+
\sum_{b\le y}S(X/b)
-
yS(y).
$$

This should be proved by covering the region $ab\le X$ by the union of $a\le y$ and $b\le y$, noting that no pair with $a>y$ and $b>y$ can satisfy $ab\le X$.

**Lemma H2: Exact periodic formula for $S(u)$.**
Status: proposed, elementary.

For real $u\ge 0$,

$$
S(u)
=
\left\lfloor\frac{u+3}{4}\right\rfloor
- \left\lfloor\frac{u+1}{4}\right\rfloor.
$$

Equivalently, with $\psi(t)=t-\lfloor t\rfloor-\frac12$,

$$
S(u)
=
\frac12+
\psi\left(\frac{u+1}{4}\right)
-
\psi\left(\frac{u+3}{4}\right).
$$

Endpoint conventions must be checked at $u\in\mathbb Z$ and at $u\equiv 1,3\pmod 4$.

**Lemma H3: Balanced sawtooth formula.**
Status: proposed, not proved.

For $X=R^2\ge 1$, $y=\lfloor\sqrt X\rfloor$, and $P(X)=N(\sqrt X)-\pi X$,

$$
P(X)
=
-4\sum_{a\le y}\chi_4(a)\psi(X/a)
+
4\sum_{b\le y}
\left[
\psi\left(\frac{X/b+1}{4}\right)
-
\psi\left(\frac{X/b+3}{4}\right)
\right]
+
O(1).
$$

This is the corrected version of Gemini's proposed formula, with $a,b\le y=\lfloor\sqrt X\rfloor$ rather than informal $a,b\le R$. It must not be marked proved until the $O(1)$ residual is derived.

**Lemma H4: Vaaler truncation for balanced hyperbola sums.**
Status: proposed technical target.

For truncation height $H$, express each sawtooth term in H3 as a finite Fourier sum plus a controlled residual. The output should have the schematic form

$$
P(X)
=
\sum_{1\le |h|\le H}\alpha_h
\sum_{a\le y}\chi_4(a)e(hX/a)
+
\sum_{1\le |h|\le H}\beta_h
\sum_{b\le y}
\left[
e\left(\frac{h(X/b+1)}{4}\right)
-
e\left(\frac{h(X/b+3)}{4}\right)
\right]
+
\mathcal E(X,H),
$$

where $\alpha_h,\beta_h\ll 1/|h|$, and $\mathcal E(X,H)$ is explicitly bounded.

**Lemma H5: Dyadic exponential-sum criterion.**
Status: target.

Find explicit conditions on dyadic estimates of the form

$$
\sum_{h\sim H_0}\frac{1}{h}
\sum_{d\sim D}c_d e(hX/d)
$$

that imply

$$
P(X)\ll_\epsilon X^{1/4+\epsilon}.
$$

This criterion should state the allowed ranges of $D,H_0$, the coefficient class $c_d$, and the loss permitted after summing over dyadic blocks.

**Lemma B1: Smoothed Poisson--Bessel sanity check.**
Status: standard/proposed for proof.

For a fixed smooth compactly supported radial mollifier $\rho$, prove the smoothed Poisson--Bessel formula and sandwich inequality, then recover

$$
E(R)\ll R^{2/3}
$$

from the trivial bound on dyadic radial sums. This is not the selected main route but should be retained as a calibration test.

Counterexample checks to run:

1. **Boundary test for H1--H3.**
   Check $X$ in the following classes:

* $0<X<1$,
   * $X=1,2,3,4,5$,
   * $X=n$ a square,
   * $X=n$ not a square,
   * $X$ noninteger near an integer,
   * $R=\sqrt X$ integer and noninteger.

2. **Endpoint convention test for $\psi$.**
   Compare the floor-compatible $\psi(t)=t-\lfloor t\rfloor-1/2$ with the Fourier-centered sawtooth convention at integer arguments. Record exactly where each convention is used.

3. **Numerical test of Gemini's proposed formula.**
   Compute

$$
E(R)-\left[
-4\sum_{a\le \lfloor R\rfloor}\chi_4(a)\psi(R^2/a)
+
4\sum_{b\le \lfloor R\rfloor}
\left(
\psi\left(\frac{R^2/b+1}{4}\right)
-
\psi\left(\frac{R^2/b+3}{4}\right)
\right)
\right]
$$

for many $R$ and verify whether it is uniformly bounded.

4. **Unbalanced versus balanced Vaaler cost.**
   Estimate the residual size when Vaaler is applied to $d\le X$ versus after the hyperbola cut $d\le X^{1/2}$. This should be done symbolically and numerically.

5. **Radial phase false-start guardrail.**
   Record that the Hessian determinant of $R\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ vanishes. Any future claim using generic full-rank two-dimensional stationary phase on this phase should be automatically flagged.

6. **Character-blindness check.**
   For each proposed exponential-sum estimate, mark whether it uses cancellation from $\chi_4$ or only the bound $|\chi_4|\le 1$.

Next round instructions:

**For `gemini_deep_think`:**

Reformulate "character blindness" as a precise dyadic estimate. Specify the coefficient class, the dyadic ranges, and what bound would be needed to reach $X^{1/4+\epsilon}$. Avoid claims that nonzero Hessian alone implies decoupling applicability.

**For `gpt_pro_thinking`:**

Write the unified Round 2 reading packet: arithmetic hyperbola as the selected main route, Bessel smoothing as a calibration route, and the exact gap list H1--H5. Include a short literature-audit checklist for Huxley, Bourgain--Watt, Li--Yang, and ANTEDB.

Confidence:

High confidence in selecting the **balanced arithmetic hyperbola/sawtooth route** as the main Round 2 direction.

High confidence that the Poisson--Bessel route remains useful for smoothing, unsmoothing, and the $R^{2/3}$ sanity check.

Moderate confidence that Gemini's balanced formula is correct up to $O(1)$ after endpoint repair; it still requires proof.

Low confidence that formal Hessian nondegeneracy of $\Phi(h,d)=hX/d$ is enough to invoke modern decoupling or Bombieri--Iwaniec estimates without substantial additional work.

Overall Round 1 judgment: productive, but no theorem improving the Gauss circle bound has been proved. The next round should verify the arithmetic foundation before attempting any high-powered exponential-sum estimate.

Selected main route:

Adopt a **two-track decomposition, with the arithmetic hyperbola/sawtooth route as the main analytic route and the smoothed Poisson--Bessel route as a normalization and sanity-check route**.

The main Round 2 objective should not be "prove the conjecture." It should be to produce a verified, endpoint-safe reduction from

$$
E(R)=N(R)-\pi R^2
$$

to balanced dyadic sums coming from the identity

$$
r_2(n)=4\sum_{d\mid n}\chi_4(d),
$$

with $X=R^2$ and target

$$
P(X):=N(\sqrt X)-\pi X=O_\epsilon(X^{1/4+\epsilon}).
$$

The selected analytic route is:

1. Prove an exact **symmetric Dirichlet hyperbola identity** for

$$
T(X):=\sum_{ab\le X}\chi_4(a),
\qquad
N(\sqrt X)=1+4T(X).
$$

2. Convert this identity into sawtooth terms using

$$
\psi(t)=t-\lfloor t\rfloor-\frac12
$$

with explicit endpoint conventions.

3. Apply Vaaler truncation only after the hyperbola cut, so the sums have length about $\sqrt X$ rather than $X$.

4. Derive the exact dyadic exponential-sum target, expected to involve sums of the schematic form

$$
\sum_{h\sim H}\frac{1}{h}
\sum_{d\sim D} c_d e\left(\frac{hX}{d}\right),
\qquad D\le X^{1/2},
$$

with $c_d$ equal either to $\chi_4(d)$ or to coefficients arising from the second hyperbola leg.

Useful fragments by source:

**From `gpt_pro_thinking`:**

The strongest contribution is the normalization into two complementary forms: a smoothed Poisson--Bessel decomposition and an arithmetic sawtooth decomposition using $r_2(n)=4\sum_{d\mid n}\chi_4(d)$. This is the right first-round foundation. The Poisson--Bessel side should remain in the repo because it gives a checkable smoothing/unsmoothing framework and recovers the classical $R^{2/3}$ estimate from trivial radial-sum bounds.

The proposed conditional benchmark

$$
A_M(R)
=
\sum_{k\ne 0}w(|k|/M)e(R|k|)
\ll_\epsilon M^{3/2}R^\epsilon
$$

is useful as a diagnostic criterion, not as a likely direct proof route. It quantifies what type of cancellation the smoothed geometric formulation would need.

The arithmetic identity

$$
P(X)
=
-4\sum_{d\le X}\chi_4(d)\psi(X/d)+O(1)
$$

is valuable as a compact exact reduction, but it should not be the final analytic form for Vaaler truncation. Before estimation, the sum should be shortened by the Dirichlet hyperbola method.

The literature-status discipline is also valuable: record Huxley, Bourgain--Watt, Li--Yang, and ANTEDB separately, and do not use any record exponent as a black-box dependency until the theorem statement and hypotheses are checked.

**From `gemini_deep_think`:**

The most useful mathematical warning is that the raw geometric phase

$$
R\sqrt{x^2+y^2}
$$

and the homogeneous model phase

$$
R\sqrt{ab}
$$

have rank-deficient Hessian. Therefore any proposed proof that applies a generic full-rank two-dimensional stationary phase or decoupling theorem directly to these phases is invalid.

The proposed symmetric hyperbola route is also useful. The exact formula as stated by Gemini should not be marked proved, but the idea of replacing the length-$X$ sawtooth sum with a balanced hyperbola decomposition is correct and should become the main Round 2 task. Gemini's review also correctly flags the analytic cost of applying Vaaler directly to the unbalanced $d\le X$ identity.

Gemini's "character blindness" warning is worth preserving as a gap: after reduction to exponential sums, one must know whether $\chi_4$ is actually being exploited or merely discarded by absolute values. However, this warning needs to be converted into precise coefficient classes and estimates.

**From `gpt_pro_thinking` Stage B review:**

The review correctly demotes Gemini's exact hyperbola formula from "proved" to "proposed." It also gives the right next-step decomposition: split the hyperbola assertion into smaller lemmas H1--H4, separating exact counting, periodic partial sums, main-term cancellation, and Vaaler truncation.

Rejected or risky ideas:

1. **Reject as proved: Gemini's exact hyperbola formula.**
   The formula

$$
E(R)
=
-4\sum_{a\le R}\chi_4(a)\psi(R^2/a)
+
4\sum_{b\le R}
\left[
\psi\left(\frac{R^2/b+1}{4}\right)
-
\psi\left(\frac{R^2/b+3}{4}\right)
\right]
+
O(1)
$$

is plausible in spirit, but it was not proved in Round 1. It must be derived from an exact hyperbola identity with $y=\lfloor \sqrt X\rfloor$, explicit endpoint conventions, and a verified bounded residual.

2. **Reject: "nonzero Hessian unlocks modern decoupling" as a theorem.**
   For the phase

$$
\Phi(h,d)=\frac{hX}{d},
$$

the formal Hessian determinant in continuous variables is nonzero. That calculation is correct, but it does not by itself imply that Bourgain--Watt, Bombieri--Iwaniec, or any decoupling theorem applies. The needed theorem, coefficient hypotheses, dyadic ranges, spacing conditions, and loss factors must be stated.

3. **Reject: abandoning Bessel methods entirely.**
   The Bessel route is risky as a direct source of new exponents because of radial degeneracy. It is still useful for smoothing, unsmoothing, checking notation, and recovering the classical $R^{2/3}$ sanity bound.

4. **Reject: "smoothing artificially erases point-mass spikes."**
   Smoothing without an unsmoothing argument is dangerous. Standard smoothing with a sandwich lemma is legitimate and should remain in the technical toolkit.

5. **Treat as risky: the radial benchmark $A_M(R)\ll M^{3/2}R^\epsilon$.**
   It is a clean sufficient condition, but not a near-term lemma. The Hessian warning suggests that generic two-dimensional nondegenerate tools are unavailable for this raw radial phase.

Known gaps:

1. **Endpoint conventions for $\psi$.**
   The identity

$$
\lfloor t\rfloor=t-\psi(t)-\frac12
$$

is exact if $\psi(t)=t-\lfloor t\rfloor-\frac12$, including $\psi(n)=-1/2$ at integers. Fourier series and Vaaler approximations usually behave differently at discontinuities. This must be recorded explicitly.

2. **Exact symmetric hyperbola identity.**
   The repo needs a proved identity for

$$
T(X)=\sum_{ab\le X}\chi_4(a)
$$

with $y=\lfloor\sqrt X\rfloor$:

$$
T(X)
=
\sum_{a\le y}\chi_4(a)\left\lfloor\frac Xa\right\rfloor
+
\sum_{b\le y}S(X/b)
-
yS(y),
$$

where

$$
S(u)=\sum_{a\le u}\chi_4(a).
$$

3. **Periodic partial-sum formula.**
   One needs a fully checked formula for $S(u)$, for real $u$, including integer endpoints. A likely exact formula is

$$
S(u)
=
\left\lfloor\frac{u+3}{4}\right\rfloor
- \left\lfloor\frac{u+1}{4}\right\rfloor
=
\frac12+
\psi\left(\frac{u+1}{4}\right)
-
\psi\left(\frac{u+3}{4}\right),
$$

with the same floor-compatible convention for $\psi$.

4. **Main-term cancellation after the symmetric cut.**
   After substituting the floor and $S(u)$ formulas, the nonoscillatory terms must be shown to equal $\pi X/4+O(1)$ at the level of $T(X)$. This is the critical algebraic step behind Gemini's proposed formula.

5. **Vaaler truncation error.**
   The truncation error must be derived with full dependence on the length $D$, Fourier height $H$, and endpoint/jump terms. The heuristic "error is length divided by $H$" is not enough.

6. **Dyadic parameter map.**
   The route needs a precise map from the hyperbola formula to dyadic ranges $D,H,T$, with $T=X$, $D\le X^{1/2}$, and $H$ chosen according to the actual Vaaler error. This must precede any appeal to Bombieri--Iwaniec-type estimates.

7. **Coefficient handling.**
   The role of $\chi_4(d)$ must be explicit. The repo should distinguish estimates that exploit the character from estimates that merely bound $|c_d|\le 1$.

8. **Literature audit.**
   Record-exponent claims should be audited from primary sources before being treated as dependencies.

New lemmas to add:

**Lemma H1: Exact symmetric hyperbola identity.**
Status: proposed, expected standard.

For $X\ge 1$, set $y=\lfloor\sqrt X\rfloor$ and

$$
S(u)=\sum_{1\le a\le u}\chi_4(a).
$$

Then

$$
\sum_{ab\le X}\chi_4(a)
=
\sum_{a\le y}\chi_4(a)\left\lfloor\frac Xa\right\rfloor
+
\sum_{b\le y}S(X/b)
-
yS(y).
$$

This should be proved by covering the region $ab\le X$ by the union of $a\le y$ and $b\le y$, noting that no pair with $a>y$ and $b>y$ can satisfy $ab\le X$.

**Lemma H2: Exact periodic formula for $S(u)$.**
Status: proposed, elementary.

For real $u\ge 0$,

$$
S(u)
=
\left\lfloor\frac{u+3}{4}\right\rfloor
- \left\lfloor\frac{u+1}{4}\right\rfloor.
$$

Equivalently, with $\psi(t)=t-\lfloor t\rfloor-\frac12$,

$$
S(u)
=
\frac12+
\psi\left(\frac{u+1}{4}\right)
-
\psi\left(\frac{u+3}{4}\right).
$$

Endpoint conventions must be checked at $u\in\mathbb Z$ and at $u\equiv 1,3\pmod 4$.

**Lemma H3: Balanced sawtooth formula.**
Status: proposed, not proved.

For $X=R^2\ge 1$, $y=\lfloor\sqrt X\rfloor$, and $P(X)=N(\sqrt X)-\pi X$,

$$
P(X)
=
-4\sum_{a\le y}\chi_4(a)\psi(X/a)
+
4\sum_{b\le y}
\left[
\psi\left(\frac{X/b+1}{4}\right)
-
\psi\left(\frac{X/b+3}{4}\right)
\right]
+
O(1).
$$

This is the corrected version of Gemini's proposed formula, with $a,b\le y=\lfloor\sqrt X\rfloor$ rather than informal $a,b\le R$. It must not be marked proved until the $O(1)$ residual is derived.

**Lemma H4: Vaaler truncation for balanced hyperbola sums.**
Status: proposed technical target.

For truncation height $H$, express each sawtooth term in H3 as a finite Fourier sum plus a controlled residual. The output should have the schematic form

$$
P(X)
=
\sum_{1\le |h|\le H}\alpha_h
\sum_{a\le y}\chi_4(a)e(hX/a)
+
\sum_{1\le |h|\le H}\beta_h
\sum_{b\le y}
\left[
e\left(\frac{h(X/b+1)}{4}\right)
-
e\left(\frac{h(X/b+3)}{4}\right)
\right]
+
\mathcal E(X,H),
$$

where $\alpha_h,\beta_h\ll 1/|h|$, and $\mathcal E(X,H)$ is explicitly bounded.

**Lemma H5: Dyadic exponential-sum criterion.**
Status: target.

Find explicit conditions on dyadic estimates of the form

$$
\sum_{h\sim H_0}\frac{1}{h}
\sum_{d\sim D}c_d e(hX/d)
$$

that imply

$$
P(X)\ll_\epsilon X^{1/4+\epsilon}.
$$

This criterion should state the allowed ranges of $D,H_0$, the coefficient class $c_d$, and the loss permitted after summing over dyadic blocks.

**Lemma B1: Smoothed Poisson--Bessel sanity check.**
Status: standard/proposed for proof.

For a fixed smooth compactly supported radial mollifier $\rho$, prove the smoothed Poisson--Bessel formula and sandwich inequality, then recover

$$
E(R)\ll R^{2/3}
$$

from the trivial bound on dyadic radial sums. This is not the selected main route but should be retained as a calibration test.

Counterexample checks to run:

1. **Boundary test for H1--H3.**
   Check $X$ in the following classes:

* $0<X<1$,
   * $X=1,2,3,4,5$,
   * $X=n$ a square,
   * $X=n$ not a square,
   * $X$ noninteger near an integer,
   * $R=\sqrt X$ integer and noninteger.

2. **Endpoint convention test for $\psi$.**
   Compare the floor-compatible $\psi(t)=t-\lfloor t\rfloor-1/2$ with the Fourier-centered sawtooth convention at integer arguments. Record exactly where each convention is used.

3. **Numerical test of Gemini's proposed formula.**
   Compute

$$
E(R)-\left[
-4\sum_{a\le \lfloor R\rfloor}\chi_4(a)\psi(R^2/a)
+
4\sum_{b\le \lfloor R\rfloor}
\left(
\psi\left(\frac{R^2/b+1}{4}\right)
-
\psi\left(\frac{R^2/b+3}{4}\right)
\right)
\right]
$$

for many $R$ and verify whether it is uniformly bounded.

4. **Unbalanced versus balanced Vaaler cost.**
   Estimate the residual size when Vaaler is applied to $d\le X$ versus after the hyperbola cut $d\le X^{1/2}$. This should be done symbolically and numerically.

5. **Radial phase false-start guardrail.**
   Record that the Hessian determinant of $R\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ vanishes. Any future claim using generic full-rank two-dimensional stationary phase on this phase should be automatically flagged.

6. **Character-blindness check.**
   For each proposed exponential-sum estimate, mark whether it uses cancellation from $\chi_4$ or only the bound $|\chi_4|\le 1$.

Next round instructions:

**For `gemini_deep_think`:**

Reformulate "character blindness" as a precise dyadic estimate. Specify the coefficient class, the dyadic ranges, and what bound would be needed to reach $X^{1/4+\epsilon}$. Avoid claims that nonzero Hessian alone implies decoupling applicability.

**For `gpt_pro_thinking`:**

Write the unified Round 2 reading packet: arithmetic hyperbola as the selected main route, Bessel smoothing as a calibration route, and the exact gap list H1--H5. Include a short literature-audit checklist for Huxley, Bourgain--Watt, Li--Yang, and ANTEDB.

Confidence:

High confidence in selecting the **balanced arithmetic hyperbola/sawtooth route** as the main Round 2 direction.

High confidence that the Poisson--Bessel route remains useful for smoothing, unsmoothing, and the $R^{2/3}$ sanity check.

Moderate confidence that Gemini's balanced formula is correct up to $O(1)$ after endpoint repair; it still requires proof.

Low confidence that formal Hessian nondegeneracy of $\Phi(h,d)=hX/d$ is enough to invoke modern decoupling or Bombieri--Iwaniec estimates without substantial additional work.

Overall Round 1 judgment: productive, but no theorem improving the Gauss circle bound has been proved. The next round should verify the arithmetic foundation before attempting any high-powered exponential-sum estimate.

# Web model modes and conversation policy

Kind: constraint
Timestamp: 2026-05-31T21:21:36

For web-agent tests and formal rounds, use ChatGPT Extended Pro for gpt_pro_thinking and Gemini Pro Deep Think for gemini_deep_think. Prefer one persistent conversation per agent per run, so each web AI has continuity across reasoning, review, judge/next-round prompts. The public repo and reading_packet.md remain the authoritative memory; web conversation memory is helpful but not authoritative.

# Research-mode quality target

Kind: constraint
Timestamp: 2026-05-31T21:35:00

This is no longer a smoke test. Use research mode for the three-round ChatGPT/Gemini web run. Take substantially more time to reason before answering. Prefer correctness, explicit hypotheses, gap detection, literature-status caution, and precise lemma formulation over speed or brevity. Do not optimize for short answers.

Each reasoning response should include: a main route, precise proposed lemmas, dependencies on known theorems, hidden assumptions, obstruction/counterexample checks, what would falsify the route, and confidence.

Each review should identify: valuable ideas from the other agent, claims that are probably correct, claims needing proof, likely false or underspecified claims, missing hypotheses, and a concrete recommendation for synthesis.

The judge should output: selected route, useful fragments by source, rejected/risky ideas, exact gaps, new lemma statements, next-round tasks, and confidence.

Use clean Markdown source. Use `$...$` for inline math and `$$...$$` for display math. Do not use bare bracket math such as `[ ... ]`.
