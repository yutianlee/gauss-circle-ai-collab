# Gauss Circle Problem

## Problem

Let

```text
N(R) = #{(m,n) in Z^2 : m^2 + n^2 <= R^2}.
```

The classical Gauss circle problem asks for the best possible exponent in the error term

```text
N(R) = pi R^2 + E(R).
```

The conjectural bound is

```text
E(R) = O_epsilon(R^{1/2 + epsilon})
```

for every epsilon > 0.

## Research Goal For This Repo

Use a multi-AI collaborative workflow to explore strategies, partial lemmas, obstacles, and proof sketches related to improving or understanding the Gauss circle problem error term.

The immediate goal is not to claim a solution, but to build a rigorous research log:

- identify plausible approaches,
- isolate precise lemmas,
- track gaps,
- test claims against known barriers,
- maintain a best current proof skeleton.

## Initial Directions To Consider

- Poisson summation and Bessel function expansions.
- Exponential sum bounds and exponent pairs.
- Smoothing and unsmoothing arguments.
- Lattice point discrepancy methods.
- Connections to the divisor problem.
- Lower-bound obstructions and omega results.
- Computational checks for small or structured ranges.
