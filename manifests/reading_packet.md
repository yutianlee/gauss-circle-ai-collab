## Current Theorem Target

Target: `P(X)=N(sqrt(X))-pi X <<_epsilon X^(1/4+epsilon)`.

Current status: conditional only. No new Gauss circle exponent has been proved.

## Current Route

H1-H3 + H4 + R5-Full + M9 imply P(X) <<_epsilon X^(1/4+epsilon).

## Active Bottleneck

`M9`: open.

For X large and X^(1/4) <= D <= X^(1/2), the fixed-coefficient reciprocal sums M_1(D;X), M_2(D;X) satisfy M_i(D;X) <<_epsilon X^(1/4+epsilon), uniformly in all active dyadic D.

Current blockers:
- `M9-M2-character-factor` (open): M2 frequency-side character factor
- `M9-near-collision-taxonomy` (open): M2 fourth-moment near-collision taxonomy
- `M9-endpoint-uniformity` (open): Endpoint uniformity over active dyadic D

## Round Target Obligations

- `M9-M2-character-factor` (open, owner `A2`): M2 frequency-side character factor
  Next action: Use the exact beta_h algebra and the h-Cauchy sign-loss diagnostic to pursue the M2 fourth-moment route first; keep CRI and direct signed bilinear estimates as secondary diagnostics.
- `M9-near-collision-taxonomy` (open, owner `A2`): M2 fourth-moment near-collision taxonomy
  Next action: Preserve the unclassified exact N=0 class. First prove or refute the denominator-paired weighted bound, then define semi-diagonal and mixed families with exact equations and mass bounds.
- `M9-regression-raw-vs-paired` (diagnostic_only, owner `A3`): Raw-vs-paired numerical stress test for M9
  Next action: After H4 source audit, rerun with the exact Vaaler Phi, official raw M1/M2 formulas, high precision, complex-weight cosine pairing, larger exact N=0 tables, and near-collision bins. Keep all output diagnostic_only.

## Do-Not-Claim Rules

- Do not claim `M9` or the final Gauss circle target.
- Do not treat computation as proof; computation evidence is diagnostic only.
- Do not use Li-Yang, Vaaler, Huxley, or Bourgain-Watt as theorem dependencies without completed source cards.
- Do not promote a claim without exact statement, dependencies, evidence, and remaining caveats.

## Agent Assignments

Use `state/next_round_prompts.md` for any judge-assigned A1/A2/A3 tasks.

Default target split:
- `A1`: synthesis, proof-draft maintenance, source-card discipline, and State Patch authoring.
- `A2`: conservative obstruction analysis for the selected M9 obligations.
- `A3`: executable diagnostics or source-card artifacts, not prose-only plans.

## Last State Patch

created: R5-Full-reconciliation, M9-M2-denominator-paired-weighted-bound, M9-M2-direct-signed-bilinear-lemma; updated: M9-M2-beta-algebra, M9-M2-fourth-moment-expansion, M9-M2-N0-diagonal-core-bound, M9-near-collision-taxonomy, M9-regression-raw-vs-paired, R5-Full, H4-source-audit, M9-M2; rejected: A2-R3-total-exact-N0-OD2-proof-promotion, A2-R3-near-collision-taxonomy-resolved, A2-R3-denominator-paired-negligibility-proved, A2-R3-Gallagher-derivative-route-closing, A2-R3-direct-exponent-pair-M2-proof; no_change: M9, M9-M1, M9-near-collision-estimate, M9-endpoint-uniformity, GC-target, H4, Li-Yang-source-audit; round score: 4; Round 3 improved M2 algebra, route selection, and diagnostic evidence, and it created a sharper denominator-paired target. It did not prove M9, resolve exact N=0 taxonomy, or close any endpoint estimate.

- Track: `M9_analytic`
- Owner: `A2`
- Blockers: `M9-near-collision-estimate`
- Next action: Use the expansion only as algebraic infrastructure for exact N=0 and near-collision estimates; do not infer an analytic bound without weighted mass estimates.

- Status: `derived_under_assumptions`
