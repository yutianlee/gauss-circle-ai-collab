## Current Theorem Target

Target: `P(X)=N(sqrt(X))-pi X <<_epsilon X^(1/4+epsilon)`.

Current status: conditional only. No new Gauss circle exponent has been proved.

## Current Route

H1-H3 + H4 + R5-Full + M9 imply P(X) <<_epsilon X^(1/4+epsilon).

## Active Bottleneck

`M9`: open.

For X large and X^(1/4) <= D <= X^(1/2), the fixed-coefficient reciprocal sums M_1(D;X), M_2(D;X) satisfy M_i(D;X) <<_epsilon X^(1/4+epsilon), uniformly in all active dyadic D.

Current blockers:
- `M9-M2-character-factor` (open): M2 frequency-side character factor
- `M9-near-collision-taxonomy` (open): M2 fourth-moment near-collision taxonomy
- `M9-endpoint-uniformity` (open): Endpoint uniformity over active dyadic D

## Round Target Obligations

- `M9-M2-character-factor` (open, owner `A2`): M2 frequency-side character factor
  Next action: Use the exact beta_h algebra and the h-Cauchy sign-loss diagnostic to pursue the M2 fourth-moment route first; keep CRI and direct signed bilinear estimates as secondary diagnostics.
- `M9-near-collision-taxonomy` (open, owner `A2`): M2 fourth-moment near-collision taxonomy
  Next action: Record that the exact N=0 arm is conditionally closed under H4. Keep the obligation open for 0<|N|~T near-collision bands, endpoint uniformity, and pointwise upgrade.
- `M9-regression-raw-vs-paired` (diagnostic_only, owner `A3`): Raw-vs-paired numerical stress test for M9
  Next action: Repair the complex-weight failure test using genuinely complex d-weights or asymmetric h-weights. Then execute raw two-sided, complex-weight cosine, real-weight Re B_h, and deliberate complex-weight failure regressions.

## Do-Not-Claim Rules

- Do not claim `M9` or the final Gauss circle target.
- Do not treat computation as proof; computation evidence is diagnostic only.
- Do not use Li-Yang, Vaaler, Huxley, or Bourgain-Watt as theorem dependencies without completed source cards.
- Do not promote a claim without exact statement, dependencies, evidence, and remaining caveats.

## Agent Assignments

Use `state/next_round_prompts.md` for any judge-assigned A1/A2/A3/A4 tasks.

Default target split:
- `A1`: synthesis, proof-draft maintenance, source-card discipline, and State Patch authoring.
- `A2`: conservative obstruction analysis for the selected M9 obligations.
- `A3`: executable diagnostics or source-card artifacts, not prose-only plans.
- `A4`: independent analytic proof-surgery for narrow sublemmas and route repair.

- Blockers: `M9-M2-character-factor`, `M9-near-collision-taxonomy`, `M9-M2-denominator-paired-weighted-bound`, `M9-M2-fourth-moment-average-to-pointwise`, `M9-M2-local-fourth-moment-LFM`
- Next action: Do not promote from AP, DP scoping, or paired/fraction subfamilies. Supply a pointwise M2 estimate, a local fourth-moment estimate valid at endpoint, or a sign-preserving direct estimate with uniformity.

### M9-M2-GM4-from-exact-plus-graded: Global fourth-moment route from exact resonance plus graded near-collision

- Status: `proposed`
- Track: `M9_analytic`
- Owner: `A1`

- Next action: Determine the exact moment or large-value theorem needed beyond derivative propagation; do not use this route to promote M9-M2.

### M9-M2-direct-signed-bilinear-lemma: Direct signed bilinear estimate for M2

- Status: `proposed`
- Track: `M9_analytic`
- Owner: `A2`
- Blockers: `M9-M2-reciprocal-SPD-route`

### M9-endpoint-uniformity: Endpoint uniformity over active dyadic D

- Status: `open`
- Track: `M9_analytic`
- Owner: `A2`
- Next action: Require each M2 route to isolate the endpoint D=X^(1/2), where the AP/local-average bridge degenerates to pointwise control.
