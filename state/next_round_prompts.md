# Next Round Prompts

Generated after round 8 in run `obligation-main`.

Source judge synthesis: `rounds/obligation-main/round_008/judge/judge-008.md`.

## For A1

Primary objectives:

1. Write the Round 9 proof-draft update reflecting the route bifurcation:
   - exact $N=0$ arm remains conditionally closed under H4;
   - absolute near-collision estimates are refuted for $D>X^{3/8+\delta}$ in the fat band;
   - absolute/structured estimates remain only a lower-range or class-restricted subroute;
   - signed $c_\chi$ becomes the upper-range primary target.

2. Complete `H4-source-audit` if possible. The source card must include Vaaler 1985 metadata, local PDF path, Theorem 6 equation (2.28), Section 7 equations (7.1)-(7.3), Theorem 18 equations (7.13)-(7.17), coefficient sign, Fejer normalization, residual constant, endpoint convention, $\Phi$ regularity, beta lower envelope, and M2 parity support.

3. Formalize the pointwise upgrade gap:
   - restate A1's derivative obstruction;
   - define the exact large-value theorem needed after a signed global moment;
   - specify separated points, threshold $V$, active $D$, and what bound would imply $V\ll X^{1/4+\epsilon}$.

4. Audit the State Patch after validation. If `M9-M2-interval-URES-strip-count` is accepted, insert it as a scoped arithmetic lemma, not as a near-collision theorem.

Exploratory allocation: formulate one signed large-sieve or spacing theorem that would imply the $c_\chi$ bound, with an immediate falsification test.

## For A2

Primary objectives:

1. Audit A4's lower-bound families in proof-detail:
   - UNC large-$M$ family;
   - TS twin-shift family;
   - W-1 window/pigeonhole lower bound;
   - parity, dyadic support, $N\ne0$, $1\le |h_i|\le H_D$, beta lower envelope, and exact $M,D,X$ ranges.

2. Replace the A2 heuristic absolute-mass obstruction with the W-1 proof. Do not label any heuristic uniform-distribution argument as `proved_internal`.

3. Audit the interval URES count:
   - verify the integer-defect convention;
   - verify nondegenerate $uv\ne0$ divisor count;
   - verify the degenerate $uv=0$ branch;
   - decide how the degenerate branch maps into paired or participation-degenerate fourth-moment classes.

4. Work on `M9-M2-signed-fat-band-constant`:
   - define $c_\chi(D;X)$ precisely;
   - state the required signed bound;
   - identify whether B-1 signed lift cancellation is strong enough, or what additional cancellation is needed.

Exploratory allocation: keep Poisson/B-process only as a backup. Supply a full theorem-shaped stationary-phase statement if pursuing it; otherwise do not promote it.

## For A3

Primary objectives:

1. Execute diagnostics, not just specify them. Required artifacts:
   - script path;
   - `python -m py_compile` log;
   - exact command;
   - Python/package versions;
   - precision settings;
   - exact dyadic convention;
   - output tables;
   - `report.md`;
   - pass/fail assertions.

2. Prioritize diagnostics that match the new $X^{3/8}$ split:
   - compute $\Sigma_{\mathrm{abs}}(0<|N|\le D^4/X)/D^2$ for $D=X^\delta$ around $\delta=3/8$;
   - compare with W-1 lower-bound prediction $D^4X^{-3/4}$;
   - test UNC and TS formula families separately.

3. Compute signed objects:
   - $c_\chi(D;X)$;
   - unsigned analogue;
   - random-sign analogue;
   - adversarial-sign analogue;
   - endpoint $D\asymp X^{1/2}$ sign ratios.

4. Fix formula regressions:
   - cosine pairing may hold for shared complex $d$-weights;
   - $\operatorname{Re}B_h$ shortcut should fail for complex weights;
   - exact integer arithmetic must be used for $N$ and rational identities.

Exploratory allocation: implement U-3$\eta$ strip enumeration, including the degenerate branch, to compare empirical counts with $X^\epsilon(1+\eta QD^2)+\Delta$.

## For A4

Primary objectives:

1. Formalize `M9-M2-signed-fat-band-constant` in lemma-bank style:
   - define the smoothed global fourth moment;
   - define signed pair weights;
   - define $c_\chi(D;X)$;
   - state all frozen-coefficient and smooth-weight hypotheses;
   - isolate diagonal/exact $N=0$ and off-diagonal contributions.

2. Expand B-1:
   - state exact assumptions on $\Phi$, $w_D$, parity, and endpoint support;
   - prove the signed lift bound with constants and error terms;
   - state clearly whether it is enough for $c_\chi$ or only a first saving.

3. Separate lower-bound families:
   - write UNC, TS, and W-1 as standalone obstruction lemmas;
   - specify which one refutes large-$M$ GNC and which one refutes the fat band;
   - include exact ranges and beta lower-envelope dependencies.

4. If time remains, attempt the lower-range absolute upper half:
   - for $D\le X^{3/8}$, decide whether U-3$\eta$ plus lift bookkeeping can prove a restricted absolute estimate;
   - isolate any class where the bound fails.

Exploratory allocation: examine whether the sign-preserving Poisson route and $c_\chi$ route are actually the same dual obstruction in different variables.

## Round Assessment

Agent scores:

| Agent | Idea quality | State evidence | Calibration | Assessment |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| A1 | 8.5 | 7.0 | 8.5 | Strong normalization and derivative-propagation obstruction; correctly rejected full-range GNC. The low-band target needed the W-1 correction and must now be $D$-restricted or signed. |
| A2 | 7.5 | 4.0 | 5.5 | Useful obstruction pressure and Poisson exploration, but over-promoted heuristic and transform claims. Needs to replace heuristics with A4's explicit lower-bound proof. |
| A3 | 7.0 | 2.5 | 7.5 | Good diagnostic design and formula-awareness, but no executed evidence yet. Must run code and target the new $X^{3/8}$ split. |
| A4 | 9.5 | 8.5 | 8.5 | Round's strongest contribution: U-3$\eta$ strip count, W-1 fat-band refutation, signed lift direction, and $c_\chi$ target. H4 dependencies and signed-bound gaps remain. |

State evidence is substantial for arithmetic infrastructure and obstruction, but not for endpoint estimates. The `mathematical_progress_score` is kept at 6 because the round narrows the proof graph and rejects a false route but does not prove `M9-M2`.
